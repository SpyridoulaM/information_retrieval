1905,The Little Train Robbery,American,Edwin Stanton Porter,,unknown,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Train_Robbery,"The opening scene shows the interior of the robbers' den. The walls are decorated with the portraits of notorious criminals and pictures illustrating the exploits of famous bandits. Some of the gang are lounging about, while others are reading novels and illustrated papers. Although of youthful appearance, each is dressed like a typical Western desperado. The ""Bandit Queen,"" leading a blindfolded new recruit, now enters the room. He is led to the center of the room, raises his right hand and is solemnly sworn in. When the bandage is removed from his eyes he finds himself looking into the muzzles of a dozen or more 45's. The gang then congratulates the new member and heartily shake his hand. The ""Bandit Queen"" who is evidently the leader of the gang, now calls for volunteers to hold up a train. All respond, but she picks out seven for the job who immediately leave the cabin.
The next scene shows the gang breaking into a barn. They steal ponies and ride away. Upon reaching the place agreed upon they picket their ponies and leaving them in charge of a trusted member proceed to a wild mountain spot in a bend of the railroad, where the road runs over a steep embankment. The spot is an ideal one for holding up a train. Cross ties are now placed on the railroad track and the gang hide in some bushes close by and wait for the train. The train soon approaches and is brought to a stop. The engineer leaves his engine and proceeds to remove the obstruction on the track. While he is bending over one of the gang sneaks up behind them and hits him on the head with an axe, and knocks him senseless down the embankment, while the gang surround the train and hold up the passengers. After securing all the ""valuables,"" consisting principally of candy and dolls, the robbers uncouple the engine and one car and make their escape just in time to avoid a posse of police who appear on the scene. Further up the road they abandon the engine and car, take to the woods and soon reach their ponies.
In the meantime the police have learned the particulars of the hold-up from the frightened passengers and have started up the railroad tracks after the fleeing robbers. The robbers are next seen riding up the bed of a shallow stream and finally reach their den, where the remainder of the gang have been waiting for them. Believing they have successfully eluded their pursuers, they proceed to divide the ""plunder."" The police, however, have struck the right trail and are in close pursuit. While the ""plunder"" is being divided a sentry gives the alarm and the entire gang, abandoning everything, rush from the cabin barely in time to escape capture. The police make a hurried search and again start in pursuit. The robbers are so hard pressed that they are unable to reach their ponies, and are obliged to take chances on foot. The police now get in sight of the fleeing robbers and a lively chase follows through tall weeds, over a bridge and up a steep hill. Reaching a pond the police are close on their heels. The foremost robbers jump in clothes and all and strike out for the opposite bank. Two hesitate and are captured. Boats are secured and after an exciting tussle the entire gang is rounded up. In the mix up one of the police is dragged overboard. The final scene shows the entire gang of bedraggled and crestfallen robbers tied together with a rope and being led away by the police. Two of the police are loaded down with revolvers, knives and cartridge belts, and resemble walking aresenals. As a fitting climax a confederate steals out of the woods, cuts the rope and gallantly rescues the ""Bandit Queen.""",open scene show interior robber den wall decor portrait notori crimin pictur illustr exploit famou bandit gang loung other read novel illustr paper although youth appear dress like typic western desperado bandit queen lead blindfold new recruit enter room led center room rais right hand solemnli sworn bandag remov eye find look muzzl dozen 45 gang congratul new member heartili shake hand bandit queen evid leader gang call volunt hold train respond pick seven job immedi leav cabin next scene show gang break barn steal poni ride away upon reach place agre upon picket poni leav charg trust member proceed wild mountain spot bend railroad road run steep embank spot ideal one hold train cross tie place railroad track gang hide bush close wait train train soon approach brought stop engin leav engin proce remov obstruct track bend one gang sneak behind hit head axe knock senseless embank gang surround train hold passeng secur valuabl consist princip candi doll robber uncoupl engin one car make escap time avoid poss polic appear scene road abandon engin car take wood soon reach poni meantim polic learn particular holdup frighten passeng start railroad track flee robber robber next seen ride bed shallow stream final reach den remaind gang wait believ success elud pursuer proceed divid plunder polic howev struck right trail close pursuit plunder divid sentri give alarm entir gang abandon everyth rush cabin bare time escap captur polic make hurri search start pursuit robber hard press unabl reach poni oblig take chanc foot polic get sight flee robber live chase follow tall weed bridg steep hill reach pond polic close heel foremost robber jump cloth strike opposit bank two hesit captur boat secur excit tussl entir gang round mix one polic drag overboard final scene show entir gang bedraggl crestfallen robber tie togeth rope led away polic two polic load revolv knive cartridg belt resembl walk aresen fit climax confeder steal wood cut rope gallantli rescu bandit queen

1910,What the Daisy Said,American,D.W. Griffith,"Clara T. Bracy, Mary Pickford, Mack Sennett",unknown,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Daisy_Said,"The film opens upon two sisters (Martha, played by Mary Pickford, and Millie, played by Gertrude Robinson) standing in a field of daisies. Millie plucks the petals off of one to divine whether he loves me... he loves me not. The girls part ways; Martha's next stop is the vegetable patch in which a lanky farmhand diligently labors with a shovel. She passes up the farmhand's polite offer to become sweethearts and promptly steals away to town to get her palm read by a woman fortuneteller. There, a mustachioed gypsy catches her eye, and he tells her a fortune in which he ""plans her future to his liking"". The pair run off together, crossing a brook into which he saves her from falling. They arrive at a waterfall where he ""induces her to believe his prophecy must be true"". After that brief exchange, Martha jubilantly skips home, passing the lanky farmhand who pays her no heed.
Arriving at the homestead, she immediately resolves to return to the waterfall. At their second meeting, the gypsy greets Martha with open arms and after some animated entreaties she meets his embrace. In a brief cutaway, Millie looks for Martha at the orchard, but can't find her. Martha reluctantly bids the gypsy adieu—after she is gone, he laughs and struts confidently. Martha's stealthy return escapes the notice of Father and Millie who are sitting on the porch of the homestead. They seem to accept the explanation of her absence when she motions to the second story of the house. Martha then talks Millie into getting her own fortune read and they slip away, hand in hand, over a rough-hewn fence, through the field of daisies, and into town. While the fortuneteller is examining Millie's palm, Martha is distracted by one of the townswomen. The crafty gypsy then swoops in and charms Millie into accompanying him to the romantic waterfall. When Martha returns to the fortuneteller's tent, Millie is nowhere to be found.
Millie, in the meantime, has bounced home and back to the waterfall, where the gypsy bids her to sit on a conveniently-placed bench. Martha wanders back to the waterfall (via the orchard), where she is horrified to find the gypsy with his arm around Millie and observes them long enough to witness him kiss Millie on the cheek. Heartbroken, Martha returns to the orchard to weep. To complicate things, Father departs the homestead and his route takes him by the waterfall where he discovers his daughter in close personal contact with the gypsy. In a fit of rage, the old man tears the gypsy from his daughter and reproves him wildly. Father raises his cane to strike the gypsy, but the gypsy impulsively fells him with a two quick blows to the torso. Aghast at what he's done, the gypsy escapes just as two passersby arrive on the scene.
The gypsy flees through the field of daisies as a growing mob of farmhands set out looking for him. After passing through an overgrown field and over the brook, the gypsy arrives at the orchard. Martha, unaware of his wrongdoing, yields to his pleading and successfully conceals him in a barrel underneath potatoes she empties out of a bushel basket. After the farmhand posse passes, and just as Father is recovering with the help of Millie and a passerby at the waterfall, the gypsy emerges from the barrel and bids the jilted Martha a hasty and perfunctory farewell. The posse eventually catch up with the gypsy back at the fortuneteller's wagon, where they warn him in no uncertain terms to leave town, which he does with a bindle over his shoulder. The dejected Martha, sitting on some wooden steps leading up from the road, looks up to find the posse marching the gypsy out of town. She wanders off to the vegetable patch where she finds solace in the arms of the lanky farmhand she had rejected earlier. The film concludes in the field of daisies where Millie abandons another round of petal plucking to walk off arm-in-arm with a strapping farmhand who appears out of the blue.",film open upon two sister martha play mari pickford milli play gertrud robinson stand field daisi milli pluck petal one divin whether love love girl part way martha next stop veget patch lanki farmhand dilig labor shovel pass farmhand polit offer becom sweetheart promptli steal away town get palm read woman fortunetel mustachio gypsi catch eye tell fortun plan futur like pair run togeth cross brook save fall arriv waterfal induc believ propheci must true brief exchang martha jubilantli skip home pass lanki farmhand pay heed arriv homestead immedi resolv return waterfal second meet gypsi greet martha open arm anim entreati meet embrac brief cutaway milli look martha orchard cant find martha reluctantli bid gypsi adieu—aft gone laugh strut confid martha stealthi return escap notic father milli sit porch homestead seem accept explan absenc motion second stori hous martha talk milli get fortun read slip away hand hand roughhewn fenc field daisi town fortunetel examin milli palm martha distract one townswomen crafti gypsi swoop charm milli accompani romant waterfal martha return fortunetel tent milli nowher found milli meantim bounc home back waterfal gypsi bid sit convenientlyplac bench martha wander back waterfal via orchard horrifi find gypsi arm around milli observ long enough wit kiss milli cheek heartbroken martha return orchard weep complic thing father depart homestead rout take waterfal discov daughter close person contact gypsi fit rage old man tear gypsi daughter reprov wildli father rais cane strike gypsi gypsi impuls fell two quick blow torso aghast he done gypsi escap two passersbi arriv scene gypsi flee field daisi grow mob farmhand set look pass overgrown field brook gypsi arriv orchard martha unawar wrongdo yield plead success conceal barrel underneath potato empti bushel basket farmhand poss pass father recov help milli passerbi waterfal gypsi emerg barrel bid jilt martha hasti perfunctori farewel poss eventu catch gypsi back fortunetel wagon warn uncertain term leav town bindl shoulder deject martha sit wooden step lead road look find poss march gypsi town wander veget patch find solac arm lanki farmhand reject earlier film conclud field daisi milli abandon anoth round petal pluck walk arminarm strap farmhand appear blue

When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, to have fun with the girls.

1911,The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Two Roses,American,Oscar Apfel,"Charles Ogle, Natalie Jerome",drama,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Arrow:_A_Tale_of_the_Two_Roses#Film,_TV_or_Theatrical_Adaptations","The novel is set in the reign of ""old King Henry VI"" (1422–1461, 1470–1471) and during the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487). The story begins with the Tunstall Moat House alarm bell, rung to summon recruits for its absent lord Sir Daniel Brackley, to join the Battle of Risingham; at which the outlaw ""fellowship"" known as ""the Black Arrow"" begins to strike with its ""four black arrows"" for the ""four black hearts"" of Brackley and three of his retainers: Nicholas Appleyard, Bennet Hatch, and Sir Oliver Oates, the parson. The rhyme posted in explanation of this attack, makes the protagonist Richard ('Dick') Shelton, ward of Sir Daniel, curious about the death of his father Sir Harry Shelton. Having been dispatched to Kettley, where Sir Daniel was quartered, and sent to Tunstall Moat House by return dispatch, he falls in with a fugitive, Joanna Sedley, disguised as a boy with the alias of John Matcham: an heiress kidnapped by Sir Daniel to obtain guardianship over her and to retain his control over Richard by marrying her to him.
As they travel through Tunstall Forest, Joanna tries to persuade Dick to turn against Sir Daniel in sympathy with the Black Arrow outlaws, whose camp they discover near the ruins of Grimstone manor. The next day they are met in the forest by Sir Daniel himself, disguised as a leper and returning to the Moat House after his side was defeated at Risingham. Dick and Joanna then follow Sir Daniel to the Moat House. Here Dick confirms that Sir Daniel is the murderer of his father, and escapes injured from the Moat House. He is rescued by the outlaws of the Black Arrow.
The second half of the novel, Books 3–5, tells how Dick rescues Joanna from Sir Daniel with the help of both the Black Arrow fellowship and the Yorkist army led by Richard Crookback, the future Richard III of England. It centres on Shoreby, where the Lancastrian forces are entrenched. Robert Louis Stevenson inserts seafaring adventure in chapters 4–6 of Book 3, wherein Dick and the outlaws steal a ship and attempt a seaside rescue of Joanna. They are unsuccessful, and after Joanna is moved to Sir Daniel's main quarters in Shoreby, Dick visits her in the guise of a Franciscan friar. Stevenson, the populariser of the tales of the Arabian nights, has Dick tell the tale of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves in Book 4, chapter 6 to help him escape from the ruined sea captain Arblaster, whose ship Dick and the outlaws had stolen.
While shadowing Sir Daniel, Dick and the outlaws encounter another group of spies interested in Joanna. After a skirmish in which the outlaws prevail, Dick finds that he has conquered Joanna's lawful guardian, Lord Foxham, who promises to give Joanna to Dick in marriage after a contemplated seaside rescue. There is irony in Foxham scolding Dick, who is nobly born, for consorting with outlaws when the outlaws are recruited in Dick and Foxham's plans to rescue Joanna. Wounded in the failed seaside rescue, Foxham writes letters of recommendation for Dick to Richard Crookback, whom Dick must find on the outskirts of Shoreby.
Richard Crookback, Duke of Gloucester, makes his appearance in Book 5. As Dick is leaving Shoreby he sees Crookback holding his own against seven or eight Lancastrian assailants, and assists his victory. Dick's accurate knowledge of the Lancastrian forces in Shoreby aid Crookback in winning the battle that he wages later that day. Dick is also successful as one of Crookback's commanders. Crookback knights Dick on the field of battle and, following their victory, gives him fifty horsemen to pursue Sir Daniel, who has escaped Shoreby with Joanna. Dick succeeds in rescuing Joanna, but loses his men in the process. He, Joanna, and Alicia Risingham travel to Holywood where he and Joanna are married. In this way he keeps his initial pledge to Joanna to convey her safely to Holywood.
In the early morning of his wedding day Dick encounters a fugitive Sir Daniel trying to enter Holywood seaport to escape to France or Burgundy. Because it is his wedding day, Dick does not want to soil his hands with Sir Daniel's blood, so he simply bars his way by challenging him either to hand-to-hand combat or alerting a Yorkist perimeter patrol. Sir Daniel retreats, but is shot by Ellis Duckworth (the outlaws' captain) with the last black arrow. Thereafter Sir Richard and Lady Shelton live in Tunstall Moat House untroubled by the rest of the Wars of the Roses. They provide for both Captain Arblaster and the outlaw Will Lawless by pensioning them and settling them in Tunstall hamlet, where Lawless does a volte face by returning to the Franciscan order, taking the name, Brother Honestus.",novel set reign old king henri vi 1422–1461 1470–1471 war rose 1455–1487 stori begin tunstal moat hous alarm bell rung summon recruit absent lord sir daniel brackley join battl risingham outlaw fellowship known black arrow begin strike four black arrow four black heart brackley three retain nichola appleyard bennet hatch sir oliv oat parson rhyme post explan attack make protagonist richard dick shelton ward sir daniel curiou death father sir harri shelton dispatch kettley sir daniel quarter sent tunstal moat hous return dispatch fall fugit joanna sedley disguis boy alia john matcham heiress kidnap sir daniel obtain guardianship retain control richard marri travel tunstal forest joanna tri persuad dick turn sir daniel sympathi black arrow outlaw whose camp discov near ruin grimston manor next day met forest sir daniel disguis leper return moat hous side defeat risingham dick joanna follow sir daniel moat hous dick confirm sir daniel murder father escap injur moat hous rescu outlaw black arrow second half novel book 3–5 tell dick rescu joanna sir daniel help black arrow fellowship yorkist armi led richard crookback futur richard iii england centr shorebi lancastrian forc entrench robert loui stevenson insert seafar adventur chapter 4–6 book 3 wherein dick outlaw steal ship attempt seasid rescu joanna unsuccess joanna move sir daniel main quarter shorebi dick visit guis franciscan friar stevenson popularis tale arabian night dick tell tale ali baba forti thiev book 4 chapter 6 help escap ruin sea captain arblast whose ship dick outlaw stolen shadow sir daniel dick outlaw encount anoth group spi interest joanna skirmish outlaw prevail dick find conquer joanna law guardian lord foxham promis give joanna dick marriag contempl seasid rescu ironi foxham scold dick nobli born consort outlaw outlaw recruit dick foxham plan rescu joanna wound fail seasid rescu foxham write letter recommend dick richard crookback dick must find outskirt shorebi richard crookback duke gloucest make appear book 5 dick leav shorebi see crookback hold seven eight lancastrian assail assist victori dick accur knowledg lancastrian forc shorebi aid crookback win battl wage later day dick also success one crookback command crookback knight dick field battl follow victori give fifti horsemen pursu sir daniel escap shorebi joanna dick succe rescu joanna lose men process joanna alicia risingham travel holywood joanna marri way keep initi pledg joanna convey safe holywood earli morn wed day dick encount fugit sir daniel tri enter holywood seaport escap franc burgundi wed day dick want soil hand sir daniel blood simpli bar way challeng either handtohand combat alert yorkist perimet patrol sir daniel retreat shot elli duckworth outlaw captain last black arrow thereaft sir richard ladi shelton live tunstal moat hous untroubl rest war rose provid captain arblast outlaw lawless pension settl tunstal hamlet lawless volt face return franciscan order take name brother honestu

On the advice of his parents, von Kammacher leaves Denmark to gain some respite from his wife's illness. Von Kammacher travels to Berlin, where he meets a young dancer named Ingigerd (Ida Orloff) and the doctor becomes fond of her and very interested in her. However she has a large amount of admirers and thus Von Kammacher gives up on her. However, while in Paris he sees an ad in the paper that she is going to New York with her father and decides to follow her. Von Kammacher buys a first ticket on the same liner as Ingigered, the SS Roland.
Aboard the ship, von Kammacher learns Ingigerd has a boyfriend with her and thus he backs down. Shortly after, he is called to treat a young Russian girl with seasickness and they nearly get romantically involved but class stops this from happening.
Halfway across the sea the Roland strikes an unseen object which causes massive flooding and dooms the ship. The passengers panic as the ship sinks into the Atlantic. Von Kammacher finds Ingigered passed out in her cabin from shock and carries her to a lifeboat. He goes back and searches in vain her father but when he can't find him, von Kammacher returns to the lifeboat and holds Ingigereds hand as the lifeboat pulls away. They watch in horror as the Roland sinks into the ocean. The liner sinks so rapidly that many of the lifeboats are never launched and several passengers are swept into the sea and drowned. By morning, only von Kammacher's lifeboat is still floating (the rest having been swamped by swimmers) and 8 still alive. They are spotted by a cargo liner and saved. Ingigerd is devastated when she is told that there are no more survivors and both her father and boyfriend have drowned.
Von Kammacher and Ingigerd arrive in New York and she is unable to continue with her career since she is still shocked over the Roland disaster.

The man leaves to go to a concession stall, St Rucopias, and Charlie comes along in his infamous tramp costume. He makes the woman laugh by almost soaking himself at the drinking fountain. He then sits next to her on the bench. The original man returns and is angry. He grabs Charlie by the face. He argues with the woman, waving his arms around and hitting Charlie with each movement. His last swing knocks Charlie clean over the bench. They leave and return to a hotel.
Charlie is despondent. He leaves the park and staggers, now apparently drunk, over a wide road, almost getting hit by a car. He arrives at the same hotel and after propositioning a girl outside, enters, falling over a man's gout-bound leg at the reception desk. He checks the register to see which room the couple are in, who are meanwhile getting drunk themselves. Rushing up the stairs he slips, and slides comically back to the foot on his stomach. He makes several more dangerously balanced comical attempts, hitting the gout-bound man and his two female friends in the process.
He approaches the hotel room, where the original couple are arguing. His key doesn't fit but the door is open and he enters, at first not seeing the couple due to his drunken state. The man boots him out. Charlie tries another room with his key and gets in. He starts to undress and goes to bed.
Meanwhile the man across the hall leaves his wife to go out. We are told she is a sleepwalker. She crosses the hall to sit on Charlie's bed. However the rain starts and the husband returns to the hotel to find his room empty. Charlie, now awake meets him at his door and claims not to know where his wife is. While the man goes down to reception, Charlie takes her back to her room but gets trapped when the man returns. He ends up on the balcony in the rain.

1914,Cinderella,American,James Kirkwood,"Mary Pickford, Owen Moore, Isobel Vernon",fantasy drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(1914_film),"Cinderella is a kind young woman who lives with her wicked stepmother and ugly stepsisters. They abuse her and use her as the house maid. Cinderella thinks she's all alone in the world, but doesn't know a fairy godmother is constantly helping her. One day, she is collecting wood from the forest and meets Prince Charming. They immediately fall in love with each other, but lose contact. Soon, a ball is arranged by the prince to look for his future wife. The stepsisters think they make a great chance in being chosen by the prince. Cinderella wants to go as well, but isn't allowed to by her cruel family.
The sisters go to a fortune teller, who announces a member of the family will be chosen by the prince. The sisters are delighted and think it will be one of the two of them. When they leave for the ball, Cinderella is left behind. The fairy godmother appears and asks if she wants to go to the ball as well. When Cinderella responds positively, the fairy godmother orders her to bring her the biggest pumpkin she can find. Cinderella does so and the fairy godmother changes it into a luxurious stage coach. She next asks for the smallest mice she can find. Cinderella brings her some mice from the house and the fairy godmother changes them into horses.
The fairy godmother next orders her to bring her the biggest rats there are. After Cinderella collected them, the fairy godmother changes them into servants. She finally changes Cinderella's poor maiden costume into a dress fit for a princess, and glass slippers, of course. She reminds Cinderella she will have to be back at home before the clock strikes midnight. Otherwise, her fine dress will turn into rags and the coach and servants will become what they were before.
As Cinderella arrives at the party, Prince Charming is already busy looking for his future wife. It is soon announced an unknown lady has arrived in a coach. Prince Charming immediately chooses her and they go to a private place where they learn to know each other. As they flirt, Cinderella notices it is almost twelve o'clock and storms out. She loses her glass slipper, before she turns into her old poor self again.
The next day, the royal heralds announce the Prince's wish to marry the woman whose foot fits the lost glass slipper. The sisters go to the palace to try fit their feet into the slippers, while Cinderella is yet again forced to stay home. It becomes clear the royal heralds every woman of the town has tried but failed to wear the slippers, except for Cinderella. Prince Charming immediately goes to visit her and is shocked when he finds out she is a poor maid. He doesn't turn his back against her, though, and he invites her to try on the slipper. When she does, she is announced as the future princess. The royal heralds give her the opportunity to behead her sisters, but she refuses to.
In the final scene, the fairy godmother appears and blesses her.

She angrily sends Lord Helpus away, saying she never wants to see him again. Distraught, when Lord Helpus arrives home he is determined to end his life. He swallows what he thinks is a glass of poison and envisions himself being tortured in Hell. Not long afterward, the girlfriend's gardener and maid explain to Minta that Lord Helpus was not flirting at all. Minta quickly sends a note of apology to Lord Helpus. upon reading it, Lord Helpus flies into a panic and summons an ambulance to help him before he dies from the fatal dose of poison. There is no danger of Lord Helpus expiring: His butler had stealthily switched the liquid in the glass to harmless water.

1914,The Escape,American,D. W. Griffith,"Donald Crisp, Blanche Sweet, Mae Marsh",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Escape_(1914_film),"The film begins with a short prologue explaining the science of Eugenics; contrasting the careful selection observed in the animal world with the less predictable breeding habits of humans. This is illustrated by the story of the Joyce family, headed by Jim Joyce (Turner), a cruel and senseless man. Joyce's son Larry (Harron) is by nature a sensitive kid, but Jim Joyce turns him into a heartless monster, strangling a cat as a sort of coming of age ritual.
Larry Joyce contracts a case of syphilis, and seeks out treatment from Doctor Von Eiden (Moore), who also takes a keen interest in Larry's sister May (Sweet). Von Eiden encourages May to make a break with her family, and she succeeds. However she is unable to find employment and enters into a relationship with a wealthy senator (Lewis) as a kept woman. While May will not marry the Senator, her sister Jennie (Marsh) does marry a man named ""Bull"" McGee (Crisp), an abusive lout just like her father.
Their infant child is killed when McGee trips over its cradle in a drunken stupor, and Jennie becomes delusional, endlessly rocking the cradle with a doll inside. McGee is repulsed by her condition and puts Jennie away quietly through selling her into prostitution. May manages to wrest Jennie away from this peril, but Jennie expires soon after.

1914,"His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz",American,J. Farrell MacDonald,"Violet MacMillan, Pierre Couderc",unknown,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty,_the_Scarecrow_of_Oz","King Krewl (Raymond Russell) is a cruel dictator in the Emerald City in the Land of Oz. He wishes to marry his daughter, Princess Gloria (Vivian Reed), to an old courtier named Googly-Goo (Arthur Smollett), but she is in love with Pon, the Gardener's boy (Todd Wright). Krewl employs the Wicked Witch named Mombi (Mai Wells), to freeze the heart of Gloria so she will not love Pon any longer. This she does by pulling out her heart (which looks somewhere between a valentine and a bland representation of a heart without any vessels) and coating it with ice. Meanwhile, a lost little girl from Kansas named Dorothy Gale (Violet MacMillan), is captured by Mombi and imprisoned in her castle. However, Dorothy runs away with the now heartless Gloria, accompanied by Pon and eventually meet the Scarecrow (Frank Moore). Mombi catches up with the travelers and removes the Scarecrow's stuffing, but Dorothy and Pon are able to re-stuff him; Gloria abandons them and wanders off.
They meet the lost little boy, Button-Bright (Mildred Harris). The party travels to the Winkie Country next and arrives at the Tin Castle of the Tin Woodman (Pierre Couderc), who has rusted solid. (The Tin Woodman resides in a Tin Castle in later Oz novels, beginning in The Emerald City of Oz'' (1910). Mombi reaches the Tin Castle, and the Tin Woodman chops off her head; however, this merely slows her down as she hunts for it and places it back on. (The Wicked Witch of the East in The Tin Woodman of Oz is later described as having done a similar thing to him when he was still human.) Having replaced her head, Mombi encounters Pon and turns him into a kangaroo.
Dorothy, Button-Bright, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman escape from Mombi by crossing a river on a raft. As in the original novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), the Scarecrow's barge-pole gets stuck in the river bed and leaves him stranded, until he is rescued by a bird. At one point in this sequence, the Scarecrow slides down the pole into the river, resulting a brief ""underwater"" sequence featuring puppet fish and a mermaid; throughout, the Scarecrow makes asides to the camera, mostly without intertitles. (At another point, the frozen Gloria even makes a malevolent stare directly into the camera.)
The party encounters the Wizard (J. Charles Haydon), who tricks Mombi by letting the group hide in the Red Wagon, pulled by the sawhorse; when Mombi attempts to follow them, the group escape out the back of the wagon. The four companions meet the Cowardly Lion, who joins them. The Wizard traps Mombi in a container of ""Preserved Sandwitches"" and paints out the ""sand"" and the plural, carrying her away in his pocket. The Scarecrow, taking a barrage of arrows, tosses Krewl's soldiers over the battlements to deal with the Cowardly Lion, who cannot climb the rope ladder over the city wall. With the support of the people, the Scarecrow is easily able to depose King Krewl. The Wizard releases Mombi, and compels her to restore Pon to his normal form and unfreeze Gloria's heart.",king krewl raymond russel cruel dictat emerald citi land oz wish marri daughter princess gloria vivian reed old courtier name googlygoo arthur smollett love pon garden boy todd wright krewl employ wick witch name mombi mai well freez heart gloria love pon longer pull heart look somewher valentin bland represent heart without vessel coat ice meanwhil lost littl girl kansa name dorothi gale violet macmillan captur mombi imprison castl howev dorothi run away heartless gloria accompani pon eventu meet scarecrow frank moor mombi catch travel remov scarecrow stuf dorothi pon abl restuff gloria abandon wander meet lost littl boy buttonbright mildr harri parti travel winki countri next arriv tin castl tin woodman pierr couderc rust solid tin woodman resid tin castl later oz novel begin emerald citi oz 1910 mombi reach tin castl tin woodman chop head howev mere slow hunt place back wick witch east tin woodman oz later describ done similar thing still human replac head mombi encount pon turn kangaroo dorothi buttonbright scarecrow tin woodman escap mombi cross river raft origin novel wonder wizard oz 1900 scarecrow bargepol get stuck river bed leav strand rescu bird one point sequenc scarecrow slide pole river result brief underwat sequenc featur puppet fish mermaid throughout scarecrow make asid camera mostli without intertitl anoth point frozen gloria even make malevol stare directli camera parti encount wizard j charl haydon trick mombi let group hide red wagon pull sawhors mombi attempt follow group escap back wagon four companion meet cowardli lion join wizard trap mombi contain preserv sandwitch paint sand plural carri away pocket scarecrow take barrag arrow toss krewl soldier battlement deal cowardli lion climb rope ladder citi wall support peopl scarecrow easili abl depos king krewl wizard releas mombi compel restor pon normal form unfreez gloria heart

They have a brief squabble then Charlie goes to the waiting room to clean the floor with a carpet sweeper. He bumps into a patient and a further squabble starts. Then back to the rear room for more squabbling.
The dentist arrives, and his first patient goes in, obviously in pain. The dentist prepares the nitrous oxide anaesthesic (also known commonly as ""laughing gas"" due to its effects prior to and after unconsciousness). With the man unconscious he pulls his tooth, but then he can't get him to wake up. He calls for Charlie and when he arrives the dentist runs off. Charlie tries to wake him and eventually tries hitting his head with a mallet. The man revives but starts laughing. Charlie knocks him out with the mallet.
The dentist then returns and Charlie is sent to the drug store to get a prescription. After more fighting with the patients he goes from Dr Pain's surgery to the Sunset Pharmacy. He strikes a man standing at a news-stand outside. He looks at a woman (the dentist's wife) and Charlie kicks him in the stomach before chasing the woman himself, and an incident occurs where she loses her skirt and runs off in embarrassment.

In the city, he meets the woman he was seeing already, and tries to work around the complication to steal Tillie's money. He gets Tillie drunk in a restaurant and asks her to let him hold the pocketbook. Since she is drunk, she agrees, and he escapes with his old girlfriend and the money.
Later that day, they see a picture show entitled ""A Thief's Fate"", which illustrates their thievery in the form of a morality play. They both feel guilty and leave the theater. While sitting on a park bench, a paperboy (Gordon Griffith) asks him to buy a newspaper. He does so, and reads the story about Tillie's Uncle Banks (Charles Bennett), a millionaire who died while on a mountain-climbing expedition. Tillie is named sole heir and inherits three million dollars. The man leaves his girlfriend on the park bench and runs to the restaurant, where Tillie is now forced to work to support herself as she is too embarrassed to go home. He begs her to take him back and although she is skeptical at first, she believes that he truly loves her and they marry. They move into the uncle's mansion and throw a big party, which ends horribly when Tillie finds her husband with his old girlfriend, smuggled into the house and working as one of their maids.
The uncle is found on a mountaintop, alive after all.

The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for an affront by one of his ancestors who in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was that if his daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to pray and try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness.
An American sailor, Tom Wilson (Frank Borzage), whose ship has been wrecked in a storm comes to them for help and shelter. Wilson falls in love with Toya and teaches her about Christianity. To the consternation of her father, Toya decides to convert and marry Tom at the local Japanese-American mission. However, her father also converts. The locals, who have been stirred up by Takeo, go on a murderous rampage against the family. They first go to the chapel but the newlyweds evade them and so they go to the beach house instead. When the mob reaches his house, Yamaki throws out the Buddha statue he had set up in his house and puts a cross in its place. The villagers are infuriated by this; they beat him to death beneath the cross and burn his house. Eventually, the volcano erupts and the village is destroyed, and Takeo dies in an avalanche. Only Tom Wilson and Toya San survive. They are taken away from the destroyed village by a United States merchant vessel.

1915,Birth of a Nation,American,D. W. Griffith,"Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh",epic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_of_a_Nation,"The film follows two juxtaposed families. One is the Northern Stonemans: abolitionist U.S. Representative Austin Stoneman (based on the Reconstruction-era Representative Thaddeus Stevens),[14][15] his daughter, and two sons. The other is the Southern Camerons: Dr. Cameron, his wife, their three sons and two daughters. Phil, the elder Stoneman son, falls in love with Margaret Cameron, during the brothers' visit to the Cameron estate in South Carolina, representing the Old South. Meanwhile, young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. During the Civil War, the young men from both families enlist in their respective armies for the war. The younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war. Meanwhile, the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout a black militia, after an attack on the Cameron home. Ben Cameron leads a heroic charge at the Siege of Petersburg, earning the nickname of ""the Little Colonel"". But he is also wounded and captured. He is then taken to a Union hospital in Washington, D.C.
During his stay at the hospital, he is told that he will be hanged. Also at the hospital, he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see Abraham Lincoln, and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben. When Lincoln is assassinated at Ford's Theatre, his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. In the wake of the president's death, Austin Stoneman and other Radical Republicans are determined to punish the South, employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the Reconstruction Era.[16]
Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic tendencies,[17] head to South Carolina to observe the implementation of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many Whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African-American fare such as fried chicken.
Meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a freedman and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and lynches him.
Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus' murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing mixed-race marriages. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's Klan regalia, now considered a crime punishable by death. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them. An intertitle states, ""The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright.""
Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room. At first, Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansmen spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan, gathered together at full strength and with Ben leading them, rides in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting.
The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of Jesus Christ. The penultimate title is: ""Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more. But instead — the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace.""",film follow two juxtapos famili one northern stoneman abolitionist us repres austin stoneman base reconstructionera repres thaddeu stevens1415 daughter two son southern cameron dr cameron wife three son two daughter phil elder stoneman son fall love margaret cameron brother visit cameron estat south carolina repres old south meanwhil young ben cameron idol pictur elsi stoneman civil war young men famili enlist respect armi war younger stoneman two cameron brother kill war meanwhil cameron women rescu confeder soldier rout black militia attack cameron home ben cameron lead heroic charg sieg petersburg earn nicknam littl colonel also wound captur taken union hospit washington dc stay hospit told hang also hospit meet elsi stoneman whose pictur carri work nurs elsi take cameron mother travel washington tend son see abraham lincoln mr cameron persuad presid pardon ben lincoln assassin ford theatr conciliatori postwar polici expir wake presid death austin stoneman radic republican determin punish south employ harsh measur griffith depict typic reconstruct era16 stoneman protégé sila lynch mulatto exhibit psychopath tendencies17 head south carolina observ implement reconstruct polici firsthand elect lynch elect lieuten governor black observ stuf ballot box mani white deni vote newli elect mostli black member south carolina legislatur shown desk display inappropri behavior one member take shoe put feet desk other drink liquor feast stereotyp africanamerican fare fri chicken meanwhil inspir observ white children pretend ghost scare black children ben fight back form ku klux klan result elsi loyalti father break relationship ben later flora cameron goe alon wood fetch water follow gu freedman soldier captain confront flora tell desir get marri frighten flee forest pursu gu trap precipic flora warn gu jump come closer leap death run forest look ben seen jump hold die carri bodi back cameron home respons klan hunt gu tri find guilti lynch lynch order crackdown klan discov gu murder also secur pass legisl allow mixedrac marriag dr cameron arrest possess ben klan regalia consid crime punish death rescu phil stoneman black servant togeth margaret cameron flee wagon break make way wood small hut home two sympathet former union soldier agre hide intertitl state former enemi north south unit defens aryan birthright congressman stoneman leav avoid connect lt gov lynch crackdown elsi learn dr cameron arrest goe lynch plead releas lynch lust elsi tri forc marri caus faint stoneman return caus elsi place anoth room first stoneman happi lynch tell want marri white woman anger lynch tell stoneman daughter undercov klansmen spi go get help discov elsi plight break window cri help elsi fall unconsci reviv gag bound klan gather togeth full strength ben lead ride gain control town news elsi reach ben other go rescu elsi free mouth scream help lynch captur victori klansmen celebr street meanwhil lynch militia surround attack hut cameron hide klansmen ben head race save time next elect day black find line mount arm klansmen outsid home intimid vote film conclud doubl wed margaret cameron marri phil stoneman elsi stoneman marri ben cameron mass shown oppress giant warlik figur gradual fade away scene shift anoth group find peac imag jesu christ penultim titl dare dream golden day bestial war shall rule instead — gentl princ hall brotherli love citi peac

1915,The Captive,American,Cecil B. DeMille,"Blanche Sweet, House Peters",historical,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Captive_(1915_film),"The Captive chronicles the life of a young woman named Sonia Martinovitch (Blanche Sweet) who lived during the midst of the Balkan Wars. She lives close to the Turkish border on a small farm in Montenegro with her older brother Marko Martinovich (Page Peters) and younger brother Milo (Gerald Ward). Nearby, a Turkish nobleman by the name of Mahmud Hassan (House Peters) lives in a lavish palace. Marko Martinovich fights in the Battle of Lule Burgess, and is tragically killed, leaving Martinovich and her remaining brother, Milo, helpless. Subsequently, Hassan is taken prisoner, and assigned to the Martinovich’s farm to help her with the chores Sonia is unable to complete without her brother.
In the beginning, Sonia holds Hassan captive with the use of her bullwhip [5] and forces him to complete tasks like getting water, baking, and plowing fields. Hassan begins to befriend young Milo to alleviate his humiliation and suffering.[5] Gradually, Sonia warms up to him and they fall deeply in love.
The war waged on, and the Turks recaptured the village where Sonia, Hassan and Milo live. Unfortunately, a drunken officer (William Elmer) tries to force himself on Martinovich, but she refuses. Fueled by love, Hassan intervenes, despite the fact that the officer shares his national origin. When the Turkish army is driven out of the village, Hassan returns home only to be faced with the grim reality that he has been stripped of his title, his land has been taken, and he has banished from his homeland, all for thwarting the drunken officer away from Sonia. Meanwhile, at the farm, a pack of unruly scavengers have burned the Martinovich family’s modest house, forcing them to abandon the place they call home. The siblings meet Hassan on the road, and the lovebirds and Milo walk off to begin a new life together.[6]",captiv chronicl life young woman name sonia martinovitch blanch sweet live midst balkan war live close turkish border small farm montenegro older brother marko martinovich page peter younger brother milo gerald ward nearbi turkish nobleman name mahmud hassan hous peter live lavish palac marko martinovich fight battl lule burgess tragic kill leav martinovich remain brother milo helpless subsequ hassan taken prison assign martinovich ’ farm help chore sonia unabl complet without brother begin sonia hold hassan captiv use bullwhip 5 forc complet task like get water bake plow field hassan begin befriend young milo allevi humili suffering5 gradual sonia warm fall deepli love war wage turk recaptur villag sonia hassan milo live unfortun drunken offic william elmer tri forc martinovich refus fuel love hassan interven despit fact offic share nation origin turkish armi driven villag hassan return home face grim realiti strip titl land taken banish homeland thwart drunken offic away sonia meanwhil farm pack unruli scaveng burn martinovich famili ’ modest hous forc abandon place call home sibl meet hassan road lovebird milo walk begin new life together6

The next day, however, he reports that the money is gone. Hishituru Tori (Hayakawa), a wealthy Japanese admirer (changed in the film's 1918 re-release to a Burmese ivory king named ""Haka Arakau""), overhears and offers her a loan, if she is willing to pay the price of her virtue.
The same day, her husband is jubilant that his gamble has paid off. She asks him for $10,000, which she explains is to cover her losses playing bridge. She visits Tori and tries to pay him back, but he refuses to cancel their bargain. She threatens to kill herself, but he is so confident that she is bluffing that he hands her a pistol. When she continues to resist his advances, he subdues her and brands her on the back of the shoulder with the seal with which he marks all of his property.

1915,The Raven,American,Charles Brabin,Henry Walthall,biography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raven_(1915_film),"The film begins by tracing Poe's ancestral heritage before Poe himself is born. After the loss of his parents, Poe is taken in by the John and Francis Allan in Richmond, Virginia. The film then jumps ahead about 15 years to Poe's time at the University of Virginia. Due to debts from playing cards and a growing interest in wine, Poe begins to have difficulties. He hallucinates that he has killed a man in a pistol duel.
Poe meets Virginia and they spend a day together, riding a horse and sitting ""beside the glassy pool of romance."" He tells her a fairy tale, a raven perching on Poe's shoulder as he finishes the story, before they go on a walk together. Upon seeing a black slave (listed in the credits only as ""Negro"") being whipped, he buys the slave with an IOU for $600.00. The slave's former owner then goes to John Allan to collect the debt. Allan calls Poe a ""scoundrel"" for causing so many bills.
After having a drink with his ""chum"" Tony, Poe goes to visit Virginia. Tony follows shortly after and the two compete for Virginia's affection. Later, Virginia says she will choose the man who guesses which hand holds a wreath behind her back. Poe allows Tony to go first and, though he guesses correctly, Virginia secretly switches the wreath to the other hand so that Poe can win. Shortly after, in front of Tony and Virginia, Allan questions Poe's spending habits. Allan causes quite a scene, despite his wife's attempts to calm him. Poe is asked to leave the Allan family but Virginia offers to come along. Poe's recently purchased slave comes along as well.
Poe has an alcohol-induced hallucination that recreates his poem (and the film's namesake) ""The Raven"". As Poe sits alone, he hears a tapping at the chamber door. The door knocker moves on its own and Poe thinks he sees the outline of a large, black bird. As Poe stumbles outside, the word ""wine"" appearing on a rock he braces himself against, he sees a ghost. As he reaches for another sip of wine, a human skull appears in place of the glass. Finally, a raven makes its way into the room, repeating the word ""Nevermore"" as Poe attempts to talk to it.
Poe, in Fordham, New York, is in ""dire poverty"" along with Virginia and her mother Maria. Virginia has a terrible coughing fit, a sign of her tuberculosis. Poe, desperate for money, unsuccessfully attempts to sell some of his work to George Rex Graham. Virginia, bothered by the cold winter weather, is kept warm by Poe's old coat from his time at West Point and from their pet black cat. She dies the next day, causing Poe great grief.
Sarah Helen Whitman is introduced at the end of the film, assisting an elderly couple. She and Poe, however, do not cross paths.

1916,"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea",American,Stuart Paton,"Lois Alexander, Curtis Benton, Wallace Clarke, Allen Holubar",action adventure,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20,000_Leagues_Under_the_Sea_(1916_film)","A strange giant ""sea creature"" has been rampaging the seas. The American naval ship Abraham Lincoln is sent to investigate, but is rammed by ""the creature"" which turns out to be The Nautilus, the fantastic submarine of the enigmatic Captain Nemo, and ""Rudderless, the 'Abraham Lincoln' drifts on"". Then, in ""A strange rescue"" he guides the sub to surface under those pitched overboard and his crew take them, including Professor Aronnax, and his daughter (who are French) below through a hatch in the surface of the deck. After they pledge not to escape, Nemo shows them the wonders of the underwater world, and even takes them hunting on the sea floor.
Meanwhile, soldiers in a runaway Union Army Balloon are marooned on a mysterious island not far from the submarine. They find a wild girl living alone on the island (""a child of nature"").
The yacht of Charles Denver arrives at the island. A former Indian colonial officer, he has been haunted by the ghost of a woman (Princess Daaker) that he attacked years ago; she stabbed herself rather than submit to him. He fled with her young daughter and then abandoned the child on the island. The long-tormented Denver has returned to see what became of her.
One of the Union soldiers schemes and kidnaps the wild girl onto Denver's yacht. Another soldier swims aboard to rescue her. At the same time, Nemo discovers that the yacht belongs to Denver, the enemy he has been seeking all these years. The Nautilus destroys the yacht with a torpedo, but the girl and her rescuer are saved from the water by Captain Nemo.
In elaborate flashback scenes to India, Nemo reveals that he is Prince Daaker, and that he created the Nautilus to seek revenge on Charles Denver. He is overjoyed to discover that the abandoned wild girl is his long-lost daughter, but his emotion is such that he expires. His loyal crew bury him at the ocean bottom. They disband and the Nautilus is left to drift to its own watery grave.[6]",strang giant sea creatur rampag sea american naval ship abraham lincoln sent investig ram creatur turn nautilu fantast submarin enigmat captain nemo rudderless abraham lincoln drift strang rescu guid sub surfac pitch overboard crew take includ professor aronnax daughter french hatch surfac deck pledg escap nemo show wonder underwat world even take hunt sea floor meanwhil soldier runaway union armi balloon maroon mysteri island far submarin find wild girl live alon island child natur yacht charl denver arriv island former indian coloni offic haunt ghost woman princess daaker attack year ago stab rather submit fled young daughter abandon child island longtor denver return see becam one union soldier scheme kidnap wild girl onto denver yacht anoth soldier swim aboard rescu time nemo discov yacht belong denver enemi seek year nautilu destroy yacht torpedo girl rescuer save water captain nemo elabor flashback scene india nemo reveal princ daaker creat nautilu seek reveng charl denver overjoy discov abandon wild girl longlost daughter emot expir loyal crew buri ocean bottom disband nautilu left drift wateri grave6
1916,The Abandonment,American,Donald MacDonald,"Forrest Taylor, Harry von Meter, Helene Rosson",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abandonment,"Dr. Edmund B. Stewart is a talented young physician who is working hard to build both his professional reputation and practice. He is engaged to Emily Thurston whose father is said to be wealthy. The Thurstons move in the best social circles and Emily is congratulated because her fiance is a successful man. Emily loves Edmund, but is unhappy at the amount of time he spends working at his practice. Stewart's work schedule has caused her to miss many social engagements.[8]
Emily grows resentful that his dedication to duty has curtailed so much of her social life; she starts spending time with Benson Heath. Heath, who has no real job, is attracted to Emily because he believes her family is quite wealthy. He has recently lost a considerable amount of money through bad investments. Heath convinces Emily to break her engagement to Edmund Stewart and asks her to marry him. Stewart, who had been driving himself to work harder, is at the point of exhaustion. Emily and Heath's marriage is the final blow to his constitution; he becomes ill. His doctors advise him to go to the country for recuperation. On the journey, Stewart sees two tramps who appear to be quite happy; he decides to see if this type of life might make him happy also. He takes off his tie, tears off his shirt collar and falls in with the tramps. The tramps later steal Stewart's money and then he has no recourse but to remain a tramp.[8]
Six months after her marriage, Emily's father dies and it is learned he was not a wealthy man as was assumed. Heath becomes quite angry when he learns that his father in law left no large inheritance. He passes a check on his already overdrawn bank account, uses the money for gambling, and then takes Emily away to avoid being arrested. The couple moves West to a house in a desolate location. The area is deserted enough that two tramps show up and set up camp not for from the home.[8]
The tramps find their way into the house, planning to loot it. Their plans are foiled by Heath's returning home, so they hide in a closet. He is drunk and when Emily tries to take the bottle away from him, he erupts into a rage. Hearing the noise, the tramps wonder what is happening, so they carefully open the closet door a bit to see. Heath is choking Emily and the tramps are horrified at the sight. One of them bolts out of the closet and wrestles with Heath to free Emily from his grasp. As the two men struggle, Heath's gun discharges and he is fatally shot.[8]
The tramps flee, but are apprehended by the sheriff. Stewart, who has been living in the tramp camp, comes up to try helping his friends. When he enters the house he sees Heath lying dead on the floor and Emily also lying there, but in a dead faint. Stewart thinks Emily has shot her husband so he tells the sheriff he is responsible for Heath's death. When Emily regains consciousness, she tells the sheriff that Stewart was not the man who struggled with her husband. As Stewart is being released by the sheriff, Emily recognizes him and tells him she always loved him; no charges were filed in the death of Heath as the sheriff's opinion is that Heath got what he deserved.[8]",dr edmund b stewart talent young physician work hard build profession reput practic engag emili thurston whose father said wealthi thurston move best social circl emili congratul fianc success man emili love edmund unhappi amount time spend work practic stewart work schedul caus miss mani social engagements8 emili grow resent dedic duti curtail much social life start spend time benson heath heath real job attract emili believ famili quit wealthi recent lost consider amount money bad invest heath convinc emili break engag edmund stewart ask marri stewart drive work harder point exhaust emili heath marriag final blow constitut becom ill doctor advis go countri recuper journey stewart see two tramp appear quit happi decid see type life might make happi also take tie tear shirt collar fall tramp tramp later steal stewart money recours remain tramp8 six month marriag emili father die learn wealthi man assum heath becom quit angri learn father law left larg inherit pass check alreadi overdrawn bank account use money gambl take emili away avoid arrest coupl move west hous desol locat area desert enough two tramp show set camp home8 tramp find way hous plan loot plan foil heath return home hide closet drunk emili tri take bottl away erupt rage hear nois tramp wonder happen care open closet door bit see heath choke emili tramp horrifi sight one bolt closet wrestl heath free emili grasp two men struggl heath gun discharg fatal shot8 tramp flee apprehend sheriff stewart live tramp camp come tri help friend enter hous see heath lie dead floor emili also lie dead faint stewart think emili shot husband tell sheriff respons heath death emili regain conscious tell sheriff stewart man struggl husband stewart releas sheriff emili recogn tell alway love charg file death heath sheriff opinion heath got deserved8

1916,Civilization,American,Reginald Barker,"Howard C. Hickman, Enid Markey, George Fisher",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(film),"The film opens with the outbreak of a war in the previously peaceful kingdom of Wredpryd. Count Ferdinand is the inventor of a new submarine who is assigned to command the new ship in battle. The King of Wredpryd orders the Count to sink the ""ProPatria"" (""for my country""), a civilian ship that is believed to be carrying munitions as well as civilian passengers. In his mind's eye, the Count sees a vision of what would happen if he sent a torpedo crashing into the liner, and he recoils. He refuses to follow his orders, saying he is ""obeying orders -- from a Higher Power."" Realizing his crew will carry out the orders, the Count fights with the crew and blows up his submarine, sending it to the bottom of the sea.
The Count's soul descends into purgatory, where he encounters Jesus. Jesus announces that the Count can find redemption by returning to the living world as a voice for peace. Jesus tells the Count, ""Peace to thee, child, for in thy love for humanity is thy redemption. In thy earthly body will I return, and with thy voice plead for peace. Much evil is being wrought in my name.""
The Count returns to life and is stoned and reviled by his countrymen. He is put on trial by the king, a modern Pontius Pilate, and is sentenced to death. Five thousand women gather at the palace singing a song of peace and pleading with the king to end the war. The mothers' plea inspires the king to visit the cell of the condemned Count. The Count is found dead in his cell, and Jesus emerges from the Count's body and takes the king on a tour of the battlefields. Jesus asks, ""See here thy handiwork? Under thy reign, thy domain hath become a raging hell!"" In the film's most famous scene, Jesus walks through the battlefields amid the carnage of war.

She is disliked and spurned by the other children, and treated coldly by the orphanage administrators. She is told by the orphanage cook Black Cindy (Madame Sul-Te-Wan) during a palm-reading that she will be cursed until she is married. Ann's stay at the orphanage is an endless series of unhappy circumstances: she steals a doll belonging to a popular girl named Goldie (Mildred Harris), then accidentally breaks the doll, thereby adding to her loneliness and misery. One day, while the children are napping, a fire breaks out in the orphanage and Ann heroically saves Goldie from the flames.
Impressed with Ann's selflessness, a kindly couple, Samuel and Elinor Knapp (Wilbur Higby and Loyola O'Connor) take her in and later adopt Ann. Ann is immediately smitten with a neighbor boy named Jimmie Vance (Robert Harron) and the two youths begin courting. Believing that her curse is coming to an end, Ann attends a motion picture with Jimmie. Enthralled by the action-filled Western film, the following day Ann imitates the film's main character Pansy Thorne while playing with a gun. Unbeknownst to Ann, the gun is loaded and a round goes off, entering a neighbor's house. Ann tentatively peers through the window and is shocked to see her neighbor, Bill Higgins (Charles Lee) lying on the floor. Believing him dead, Ann is despondent, sure that the curse is still upon her and fearful that Jimmie will never marry her now that she has committed murder.
After tearfully confessing to her ""crime"" and a subsequent investigation into the peculiar disappearance of the body of Mr. Higgins, the town is shocked when Mr. Higgins returns home several days later and reveals that he had simply left town to avoid his wife's incessant nagging. Overjoyed, Jimmie and Ann marry and the ""hoodoo"" is lifted.

1916,Manhattan Madness,American,Allan Dwan,"Douglas Fairbanks, Jewel Carmen",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Madness,"Robbers steal the ""Koor-Hal Ruby"", killing four in the process, and elude the police. Newspaper managing editor Phil Bane sends for conceited crime writer/criminologist George Melville to write stories and boost his circulation. Melville claims the crime was masterminded by Andre Berlea, a man thought to have died four years before. He predicts to reporters that Berlea will next steal the Sunburst Diamond and kill the only witness, a butler, to the ruby theft. Seconds later, they receive news that a butler has been murdered.
On his way to see Bane, Melville is about to give a female panhandler some money when he is distracted by a car accident. The woman takes the opportunity to steal his wallet. He follows her to a beauty salon. When she emerges, after a complete makeover, she begs him not to do anything until after 8 o'clock. Over dinner, she explains that she ran away from her cruel husband with another man, from whom she later separated. Her ex-husband is finally letting her see her daughter, who turned four that day, and she needed the money to make herself presentable. They drive to a fancy mansion. Mrs. Northrop faints when she is shown a coffin; Mr. Northrop explains that the child died two days before. However, all is not as it seems. It turns out to be an elaborate practical joke on Melville concocted by the reporters; one of them is writing a play, Fury's Road, and Claire Peyton (""Mrs. Northrop"") is the star. Mr. Northrop was played by the producer, Blackton Gregory.
Minutes later, they learn that a famous painting has been stolen from next door. Gregory savors his latest acquisition in secret. When a henchman suggests getting rid of Melville, Gregory turns him down. Having found a worthy foe, he will not do something so crude. He goes to see Melville and hires him to help with the play. He asks why Melville is so sure that Berlea is alive. Melville explains that he believes that Berlea has a compulsion to own beautiful things. Before he ""died"", he tried to buy three such objects, but was turned down. Now two of them have been stolen. Melville predicts that the third, the Starburst Diamond, will be purloined on Saturday at 11 pm. Bane has faith in him and keeps his staff after hours and notifies the authorities, who set up a stakeout at the bank where the jewel is stored. When the deadline passes without anything happening, Bane fires Melville. Melville agrees to go to Gregory's retreat for a rest.
Gregory's men have dug a tunnel between the theater where the play, set on the front lines of World War I, will be performed and the bank.

1916,One A.M.,American,Charlie Chaplin,Charlie Chaplin,short comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_A.M._(1916_film),"The film opens with a scene of a wealthy young man (Chaplin) arriving at his house in a taxi late at night after a night of heavy drinking. He struggles with the car door when exiting the car and then in paying the taxi driver (Albert Austin). When he gets to his front door, he thinks that he has forgotten the key and has to enter through the window. While climbing in through the window, he steps into a fishbowl that's placed underneath it and then almost falls down when the carpet underneath him slides. After finding his balance again, he goes through his pockets and realises that the key has been there all the while. He goes back through the window and enters through the front door.
Inside the house, the furniture and other inanimate objects become almost insurmountable obstacles for the drunk. He struggles to balance on the sliding carpets and wonders whether he is wearing skates. Falling down, he lands between a tiger rug and a stuffed Eurasian lynx, which terrify him as he thinks they are real. He goes over to the table and tries to pour himself a drink, but first he accidentally spins the table top around and then does not manage to pour the drinks inside a glass. He then unsuccessfully attempts to light a cigarette, and then tries to head up the stairs to his bedroom. He fails several times in climbing them; a large cuckoo clock on the upstairs landing also poses a problem. He becomes increasingly creative with his attempts to climb the stairs, for example by using mountain climbing gear.
When he finally reaches his bedroom, he struggles to open his Murphy bed and ends up wrecking it. He gives up on the idea of sleeping in his bed and goes to bathroom. He enters the shower and accidentally turns it on. Soaked, he then gets into the bathtub and falls asleep under a towel.",film open scene wealthi young man chaplin arriv hous taxi late night night heavi drink struggl car door exit car pay taxi driver albert austin get front door think forgotten key enter window climb window step fishbowl that place underneath almost fall carpet underneath slide find balanc goe pocket realis key goe back window enter front door insid hous furnitur inanim object becom almost insurmount obstacl drunk struggl balanc slide carpet wonder whether wear skate fall land tiger rug stuf eurasian lynx terrifi think real goe tabl tri pour drink first accident spin tabl top around manag pour drink insid glass unsuccess attempt light cigarett tri head stair bedroom fail sever time climb larg cuckoo clock upstair land also pose problem becom increasingli creativ attempt climb stair exampl use mountain climb gear final reach bedroom struggl open murphi bed end wreck give idea sleep bed goe bathroom enter shower accident turn soak get bathtub fall asleep towel

Meanwhile, Richard's wife, Edith, has been keeping a secret from him for many years: she has been seeing a doctor, one Herman Malfit, who performs abortions so that her busy social life will not be interrupted by the inconvenience of pregnancy. She suggests it as an option for her friend Mrs. William Carlo, who is with child. Mrs. Carlo has the abortion.

His wife, Mrs. Hoadley (Julia Swayne Gordon) is equally cruel to the children, especially Polly.[3]
One day, Polly Biggs takes the children fishing and meets a young man named John Oxmore (Antonio Moreno), who is the son of the opposing mayoral candidate. When she returns home, Polly discovers that her uncle intends to send all the children to the poorhouse as soon as the election is over. Polly plans to take revenge on her uncle and immediately takes the children to the poorhouse herself, rather than let her uncle do so. Mayor Hoadley, frightened that voters may be incensed to learn that his nieces and nephews are living as orphans in a squalid poorhouse, goes to retrieve them. When Polly sees his car arriving at the poorhouse, she and the children flee. They find an unoccupied cabin in the woods where the brood of youngsters settle in.

1917,His Wedding Night,American,Roscoe Arbuckle,"'Fatty' Arbuckle, Buster Keaton",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Wedding_Night,"Arbuckle plays a drug store clerk, soda jerk, and gas station attendant, who can be both lazy and dishonest. After he mixes a soda for one customer with elaborate gestures and juggling of utensils, he attends the perfume counter, where another customer has been indulging herself with a free sample. After he confronts her, he is distracted while an African American customer steps up to the counter. When the clerk hugs her and then realizes it is a different customer, he almost faints. Later on, while still on the job, he proposes to his boss's daughter Alice (Alice Mann), and she gleefully accepts. The scene then switches to the gas pump, where Arbuckle's character switches the sign to a higher price when a person with an expensive car drives up. After the car drives away, he drinks from the pump. Meanwhile inside, Al (Al St. John), another admirer of Alice, also proposes to her while they are eating watermelon. When she is tells him she is already engaged to the soda clerk, Al becomes outraged and begins causing a commotion in the store. After a food fight that involves several customers, the owner of the store throws Al out. Later in the day a delivery boy (Buster Keaton), after a prat fall over a bicycle rack, delivers Alice's wedding dress to her room above the store. He agrees to model it for her when she expresses worry that it will not fit her. When a male customer enters and annoys the clerk, he puts chloroform in the sample bottle to knock him out if he comes in again. The male customer never returns, but several female customers end up knocking themselves out. When a pretty woman arrives, Fatty deliberately knocks her unconscious so he can kiss her. He knocks out his boss, who could be a witness, as well. After he sees another customer sampling the perfume, he is shocked when it has no effect on her, even when she drinks it. He investigates by spraying himself with the ""perfume"" but is himself knocked out. With Arbuckle's character unconscious, Al, the rejected lover, sneaks into the store with his gang and kidnaps the delivery boy, thinking it is Alice, since his face was covered by a wedding veil. They tie him up and put a sack over his head and, escaping out of the second story window, take the delivery boy by to the justice of the peace's office. There they attempt to force the justice of peace to marry them at gunpoint. However, the soda clerk regains consciousness and, thinking the group has actually kidnapped Alice, pursues the group, but only after he comically struggles with a mule that he wants to hook to a wagon. He thwarts the gang just in time. He then convinces the justice of the peace to marry him to the delivery boy, whom, since his head is still covered in the sack, he thinks is Alice. Alice, discovering what has happened, gets on a bicycle and heads to the justice of the peace's office as well. She arrives in time to stop the clerk from marrying the delivery boy. Arbuckle's character then throws Keaton's character into the room with Al and his henchmen. While that scene of slapstick fighting goes on in that room, the soda clerk and Alice must have been married, for in the final scene the clerk pays the justice of the peace but then sprays him with the chloroform in the perfume bottle and takes his money back.

1917,The Immigrant,American,Charles Chaplin,"Charlie Chaplin, Edna Purviance",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immigrant_(1917_film),"The film begins aboard a steamer crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and initially showcases the misadventures of an unnamed immigrant, the Tramp (Chaplin) who finds himself in assorted mischief while, among other things, playing cards, eating in a mess hall, and avoiding seasick passengers. Along the way, he befriends another unnamed immigrant (Purviance) who is traveling to America with her ailing mother. The two are robbed by a pickpocket who is losing in gambling. The Tramp, feeling sorry for the two penniless women, attempts to secretly place his winnings from his card game in the woman's pocket, but ends up being mistakenly accused of being a pickpocket. The woman manages to clear the Tramp's name. Upon arrival in America, the Tramp and the woman part company.
Later, hungry and broke, the tramp finds a coin on the street outside a restaurant and pockets it. He doesn't realize there is a hole in his pocket and the coin has fallen straight through and is back on the ground. He enters the restaurant, where he orders a plate of beans. There, he is reunited with the woman and discovers her mother is dead. The Tramp orders a meal for her.
As they eat, they watch the restaurant's burly head waiter (Campbell) and other waiters attack and forcibly eject a patron who is short 10 cents in paying his bill. The Tramp, intimidated by the waiter, checks and now realizes he has lost his coin. Terrified of facing the same treatment as the man he saw thrown out, the Tramp begins planning how he will fight the huge man. Soon, however, he finds the same coin fallen from the head waiter's pocket onto the floor and makes many failed attempts to retrieve it without notice. He finally retrieves the coin and nonchalantly pays the waiter only to be thunderstruck when the waiter reveals the coin to be fake. Once again, the Tramp prepares for the fight of his life. Just then, a visiting artist spots the Tramp and the woman and offers them a job to pose for a painting. The two agree. The artist offers to pay for the Tramp and the woman's meal, but the Tramp declines the offer several times for reasons of etiquette, intending to eventually accept the artist's offer; however, he's dismayed when the artist does not renew his offer to pay at the last moment. The artist pays for his own meal and leaves a tip for the waiter. The Tramp notices that the tip is enough to cover the couple's meal and, without the artist noticing, palms the tip and presents it to the waiter as his own payment for his and the woman's meal. As a final riposte, he lets the waiter keep the remaining change - one small coin - after paying his bill. The waiter thinks the artist himself has given no tip whatsoever, and is clearly upset at this supposed action.
Afterwards, outside a marriage license office in the rain, the Tramp proposes marriage to the woman, who is coy and reluctant until the Tramp physically carries her into the office while she waves her arms and kicks her feet in protest.",film begin aboard steamer cross atlant ocean initi showcas misadventur unnam immigr tramp chaplin find assort mischief among thing play card eat mess hall avoid seasick passeng along way befriend anoth unnam immigr purvianc travel america ail mother two rob pickpocket lose gambl tramp feel sorri two penniless women attempt secretli place win card game woman pocket end mistakenli accus pickpocket woman manag clear tramp name upon arriv america tramp woman part compani later hungri broke tramp find coin street outsid restaur pocket doesnt realiz hole pocket coin fallen straight back ground enter restaur order plate bean reunit woman discov mother dead tramp order meal eat watch restaur burli head waiter campbel waiter attack forcibl eject patron short 10 cent pay bill tramp intimid waiter check realiz lost coin terrifi face treatment man saw thrown tramp begin plan fight huge man soon howev find coin fallen head waiter pocket onto floor make mani fail attempt retriev without notic final retriev coin nonchalantli pay waiter thunderstruck waiter reveal coin fake tramp prepar fight life visit artist spot tramp woman offer job pose paint two agre artist offer pay tramp woman meal tramp declin offer sever time reason etiquett intend eventu accept artist offer howev he dismay artist renew offer pay last moment artist pay meal leav tip waiter tramp notic tip enough cover coupl meal without artist notic palm tip present waiter payment woman meal final ripost let waiter keep remain chang one small coin pay bill waiter think artist given tip whatsoev clearli upset suppos action afterward outsid marriag licens offic rain tramp propos marriag woman coy reluct tramp physic carri offic wave arm kick feet protest

She and Becky (Pitts), another slavey, become close friends who share their joys and sorrows. Christmastime draws near and the girls watch the preparations wistfully. Their loneliness arouses the sympathy of a servant of the rich Mr. Carrisford. On the night before Christmas he prepares a spread for the slaveys in their attic.

Warde,"Florence La Badie, Holmes Herbert",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Without_a_Country_(1917_film),"As described in a film magazine,[5] Barbara Norton (La Badie) and her brother Tom (Marlo), orphaned children of a veteran who gave his life for his country, go to live with their uncle Phineas (Howard) and aunt (Hastings) in the city. It is just before the entrance of the United States into the European war and the uncle is a pacifist. He holds meetings at home where Barbara assists him. Barbara's brother is a loyal American and is greatly troubled by the uncle's expectations to count on him. Barbara meets John Alton (Herbert), who wins her promise to be his wife. They are very happy until war is declared and Barbara cannot bear the thought of her future husband not doing service for his country. His ""Peace at Any Price"" button is the last straw and she gives him a choice of either joining the ""colors"" or breaking the engagement. John declares that he is a true pacifist and Barbara, believing that a man who cannot support his country is that country's enemy, breaks the engagement publicly. Her fiance becomes very unpopular at his club because of his views and is taken to task by one of his father's friends. Having lost Barbara and his popularity makes him resent the constant references to the United States and his debt to his country, and he curses his native land. Barbara enlists as a Red Cross nurse and her brother as a soldier. Later, an old friend of John's family, Pop Milton (Dundan), gives him a copy of The Man Without a Country and asks him to read it and rise above his treasonous views. He does so, and as he reads the immortal story the patriotic spirit of Barbara comes to him in a vision of Columbia who tells him that in a previous life he was the Philip Nolan of the story. She takes him back to historic times and shows him a succession of scenes from the book. The man of today sees with horror the famous court martial in which he was sentenced to never hear of the United States again, the tragedy of the careful carrying out of the sentence, and the pitiful death of the man, made easier by the humanity of Captain Danforth (Gilmour), who gives him a brief history of the land he learns to bless before he dies.

1917,A Modern Musketeer,American,Allan Dwan,"Douglas Fairbanks, Marjorie Daw",adventure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modern_Musketeer,"The film opens with a sequence in which D'Artagnan (Douglas Fairbanks) rides up to a tavern on horseback and ends up brawling with sword and fist with the patrons inside in his haste to approach a fair young stranger. After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker (also played by Fairbanks).
Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father's concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his (sometimes unwanted) chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned's father gives him the modern equivalent: a car.
While driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer (the ""richest man in Yonkers""), Ned is quite taken with the lovely ""Park Avenue flapper"" Elsie Dodge. Her mother, the third passenger, sees her only daughter's marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits. Vandeteer buys what he wants, and he wants Elsie. She, however, loathes her suitor; she much prefers young Ned.
Ned comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks. He takes the party (with Elsie in the front seat beside him) to their Grand Canyon resort hotel. There, Vandeteer tells Ned to stay away from the ladies. John Blabb, who works for ""Town Topics"", informs Ned that Vandeteer already has three wives hidden away somewhere.
Meanwhile, Chin-de-dah, the Native American leader of an outlaw gang hiding in a tributary canyon, is bored. He decides to kidnap a white woman to be his wife (his last ""wife"" is shown to have committed suicide). He goes to the resort, pretending to be a guide, and selects Elsie as his target. Ned is suspicious, but Vandeteer hires him. Vandeteer and Elsie set out for a horse ride down the canyon with their guide. Ned uses the time to persuade Mrs. Dodge that her daughter's happiness should take priority over their financial security.
James Brown, a member of the gang who knows and hates Vandeteer, gleefully tells Ned about the man's impending demise and Chin-de-dah's intentions toward Elsie. Ned shames him into helping with a rescue. They reach the camp in time to free Elsie and Vandeteer, but remain in peril. Vandeteer offers Ned $100,000 to save his life; Ned makes him put it in writing. Then they are lifted up the sheer cliff by a rope pulled by a horse. Once they are safe, Brown wants to kill Vandeteer, who falsely incriminated him in Vandeteer's own scam and stole his wife and children. Vandeteer ends up clinging to the cliffside, kept from falling to his death only by Ned's grip. Under Ned's direction, he writes a note exonerating Brown. Ned persuades Brown to let Vandeteer live, and promises to split the reward with him. Once they are alone, Elsie kisses her rescuer.",film open sequenc dartagnan dougla fairbank ride tavern horseback end brawl sword fist patron insid hast approach fair young stranger triumph morph modern day ned thacker also play fairbank ned born rais kansa mother pass along love dartagnan three musket despit father concern good fact ned get troubl sometim unwant chivalr attempt help women final ned stand decid leav dull kansa mirror scene dartagnan astrid somewhat lessthannobl steed present father departur home ned father give modern equival car drive desert come upon chauffeurdriven automobil stop road ahead wash away unimpress one passeng middleag forrest vandet richest man yonker ned quit taken love park avenu flapper elsi dodg mother third passeng see daughter marriag vandet solut dire financi strait vandet buy want want elsi howev loath suitor much prefer young ned ned come idea put car railroad track take parti elsi front seat besid grand canyon resort hotel vandet tell ned stay away ladi john blabb work town topic inform ned vandet alreadi three wive hidden away somewher meanwhil chindedah nativ american leader outlaw gang hide tributari canyon bore decid kidnap white woman wife last wife shown commit suicid goe resort pretend guid select elsi target ned suspici vandet hire vandet elsi set hors ride canyon guid ned use time persuad mr dodg daughter happi take prioriti financi secur jame brown member gang know hate vandet gleefulli tell ned man impend demis chindedah intent toward elsi ned shame help rescu reach camp time free elsi vandet remain peril vandet offer ned 100000 save life ned make put write lift sheer cliff rope pull hors safe brown want kill vandet fals incrimin vandet scam stole wife children vandet end cling cliffsid kept fall death ned grip ned direct write note exoner brown ned persuad brown let vandet live promis split reward alon elsi kiss rescuer

1918,Mickey,American,"F. Richard Jones, James Young",Mabel Normand,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_(1918_film),"Mickey (Normand) is an adult orphan who has been raised since girlhood in poverty near Feather River, California by an unsuccessful miner, Joe Meadows, and his housekeeper, Minnie. Mickey is the free-spirited, uncultured daughter of the miner's deceased partner. Meadows took charge of Mickey at his dying partner's request. Mickey is sent to live in Great Neck, Long Island--part of suburban New York City--with her aunt (Mrs. Geoffrey Drake) and her family. Mrs. Drake is under the impression that Mickey is wealthy and well refined. When Mickey arrives at her aunt's luxurious home, the aunt is disappointed that she is not well-to-do and puts her to work as a servant. Mickey's presence there sparks an awkward love triangle involving her, her cousin (Elsie Drake), and young mining executive Herbert Thornhill (Wheeler Oakman) whom Mickey first encountered in California. Just after Mickey is sent packing, a telegram arrives for her announcing that a vein has been struck on Joe's Tomboy mine and she is suddenly worth millions. Mrs. Drake's opinion of Mickey changes quickly and she is welcomed back--in the hope she and Reggie Drake will become a couple. Herbert had recently proposed to Elsie, but realizes he truly loves Mickey. Shortly afterward, Herbert receives a telegram from his lawyer, Tom Rawlings, explaining that his mining claims are now invalid and thus worthless. Elsie and Mrs. Drake find the telegram and call off the wedding because Herbert is now bankrupt. Herbert tries to regain his fortune by borrowing $5,000 and betting it on a horse race. The race is rigged--and Mickey finds out about the plot. Just as the race is about to begin, Mickey dresses in jockey silks, unhorses the crooked jockey, and tries to win the race by riding it for Herbert. Just as it appears Mickey's horse will win, she falls from her mount. Some time later Mickey reluctantly goes horseback riding with Reggie who tries to molest her in an abandoned house. Herbert arrives on the scene, battles Reggie, and rescues Mickey as she is dangling dangerously from the rooftop. Mickey and Herbert are married. As they depart on their honeymoon, a note arrives from lawyer Rawlings explaining the earlier telegram about his mining interests being worthless was a ruse designed to get Herbert out of his loveless engagement to Elsie Drake. The film ends with both Mickey and Herbert happily in love, wed, and exceedingly wealthy.",mickey normand adult orphan rais sinc girlhood poverti near feather river california unsuccess miner joe meadow housekeep minni mickey freespirit uncultur daughter miner deceas partner meadow took charg mickey die partner request mickey sent live great neck long islandpart suburban new york citywith aunt mr geoffrey drake famili mr drake impress mickey wealthi well refin mickey arriv aunt luxuri home aunt disappoint welltodo put work servant mickey presenc spark awkward love triangl involv cousin elsi drake young mine execut herbert thornhil wheeler oakman mickey first encount california mickey sent pack telegram arriv announc vein struck joe tomboy mine suddenli worth million mr drake opinion mickey chang quickli welcom backin hope reggi drake becom coupl herbert recent propos elsi realiz truli love mickey shortli afterward herbert receiv telegram lawyer tom rawl explain mine claim invalid thu worthless elsi mr drake find telegram call wed herbert bankrupt herbert tri regain fortun borrow 5000 bet hors race race riggedand mickey find plot race begin mickey dress jockey silk unhors crook jockey tri win race ride herbert appear mickey hors win fall mount time later mickey reluctantli goe horseback ride reggi tri molest abandon hous herbert arriv scene battl reggi rescu mickey dangl danger rooftop mickey herbert marri depart honeymoon note arriv lawyer rawl explain earlier telegram mine interest worthless ruse design get herbert loveless engag elsi drake film end mickey herbert happili love wed exceedingli wealthi

The duo, aided by dozens of volunteers (all of whom somehow manage to fit inside Buster's small car) set off to track down the bootlegers.

After Fatty washes his pants in a river (while Buster is wearing them) and leaves them to dry in a tree, he meets Alice (Alice Lake), the daughter of Jud Grew (Dudley) the head bootlegger with whom he develops a romance.
After fighting another bootlegger who is madly in love with Alice (St John) Fatty reunites with Buster and the two stumble across the bootlegger's storage space where they find a stash of illegal moonshine. Fatty is ambushed and taken away by the bootlegger but Buster gets away and dispatches of the love rival bootlegger by pushing him off a cliff.
Fatty is taken back to the bootlegger's hideout where, taking inspiration from The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, he escapes by pretending to be dead so that the bootleggers will throw him into the river, after being thrown into the water he floats downstream before swimming to shore where he reunites with Buster. The two make a plan to rescue Alice and to take down the bootlegger but realize that their band of volunteers is nowhere to be found. The love rival bootlegger from earlier sneaks up on them, knocks out Keaton and with help from his fellow bootleggers takes Arbuckle to a cabin and lights the fuse to a bomb inside. The cabin explodes but Arbuckle breaks the fourth wall by having the camera wound backwards so that the cabin reassembles itself and he emerges totally unharmed. Arbuckle takes out the love rival bootlegger by using a gun that he has modified so that it can shoot around corners and Buster dispatches of the remaining bootleggers except for the leader.
The leader proclaims that Fatty has proven himself worthy and gives him his blessing to marry Alice but Fatty immediately refuses, revealing that he already has a wife.

1918,Out of the Inkwell,American,Max Fleischer Dave Fleischer,,animated series,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_Inkwell,"The series is the result of three experimental short films Max Fleischer produced independently in the period 1914-1916 to demonstrate his invention, the rotoscope, which was a device made up of a movie projector and a stand used as an aid to obtain realistic movements in cartoons . The rotoscope projected a film film through an opening in the stand, covered by a glass plate acting as a design surface. The image on the projected film was drawn on paper, advancing the film one frame at a time as each drawing was made. Brother Dave Fleischer was working as clowns at Coney Island, and served as a model for what would become their first famous character, Koko the Clown.
Out of the Inkwell was started at Bray Productions as a monthly release at The Bray's Pictorgraph Screen Magazine produced for Paramount Pictures from 1918 to 1920 and later for Goldwyn Pictures in 1921. In the same year, Fleischer brothers opened their studio, And in 1923 the clown who had previously no name began to be known as Ko-Ko when veteran animator Dick Huemer became the new director of animation. Huemer, who started animating with the Mutt and Jeff series in 1916, brought the influence of that series into Out of the Inkwell and created a small canine partner named Fitz. Huemer also redesigned the clown for animation and brought the Fleischer away from their dependence on the rotoscope. He also defined the design style with its distinctive inking quality for which the series was famous.
But it was the integration and interaction of live action sequences featuring Max Fleischer who spun the series. Generally, cartons begin live action by showing Max who begins his day. He begins to draw characters on paper, or open the inkwell and they come out and interact with reality. An image of Ko-Ko at The Chinese Restaurant (1927) of The Inkwell Imps series, with Koko il Clown and Fitz the Dog.
The Out of the Inkwell series lasted from 1918 to 1926, the following year was renamed The Inkwell Imps for Paramount and continued until 1929. Fleischer continued in the series, acting as an actor, producer, screenwriter and animator for his studio Out of The Inkwell Films, producing 62 episodes of Out of the Inkwell and 56 by The Inkwell Imps. Although the Inkwell Imps series was replaced by Talkartoons in 1929, Koko il Clown returned in 1931 as a supporting character with Bimbo and Betty Boop. Koko's latest cinematic appearance was in the hilarious Betty Boop Gas cartoon (1934), which was a remake of The Cure (1924) of this series. Koko had a short cameo in his only color film appearance in the episode of Screen Songs Toys will be Toys (1949).
In 1955, short films of the Out of the Inkwell series, together with another 2500 Paramount pre-1950 shorts, were sold to television, the majority acquired by U.M. & M. TV. Corp. In 1958 Max Fleischer activated a new study in a partnership with Hal Seeger, and in 1960 produced a television series called Out of the Inkwell, consisting of 100 episodes of five minutes each. In the new color series, KoKo had a clown girl named KoKette and an antagonist named Mean Moe. Larry Storch dubbed KoKo and all the supporting characters. Much of the shorts in the original series are now in the public domain.",seri result three experiment short film max fleischer produc independ period 19141916 demonstr invent rotoscop devic made movi projector stand use aid obtain realist movement cartoon rotoscop project film film open stand cover glass plate act design surfac imag project film drawn paper advanc film one frame time draw made brother dave fleischer work clown coney island serv model would becom first famou charact koko clown inkwel start bray product monthli releas bray pictorgraph screen magazin produc paramount pictur 1918 1920 later goldwyn pictur 1921 year fleischer brother open studio 1923 clown previous name began known koko veteran anim dick huemer becam new director anim huemer start anim mutt jeff seri 1916 brought influenc seri inkwel creat small canin partner name fitz huemer also redesign clown anim brought fleischer away depend rotoscop also defin design style distinct ink qualiti seri famou integr interact live action sequenc featur max fleischer spun seri gener carton begin live action show max begin day begin draw charact paper open inkwel come interact realiti imag koko chines restaur 1927 inkwel imp seri koko il clown fitz dog inkwel seri last 1918 1926 follow year renam inkwel imp paramount continu 1929 fleischer continu seri act actor produc screenwrit anim studio inkwel film produc 62 episod inkwel 56 inkwel imp although inkwel imp seri replac talkartoon 1929 koko il clown return 1931 support charact bimbo betti boop koko latest cinemat appear hilari betti boop ga cartoon 1934 remak cure 1924 seri koko short cameo color film appear episod screen song toy toy 1949 1955 short film inkwel seri togeth anoth 2500 paramount pre1950 short sold televis major acquir um tv corp 1958 max fleischer activ new studi partnership hal seeger 1960 produc televis seri call inkwel consist 100 episod five minut new color seri koko clown girl name kokett antagonist name mean moe larri storch dub koko support charact much short origin seri public domain

Her wealthy guardians try to prevent her from being exposed to all the bad that is happening in the world. She is not allowed to leave her room in a London mansion and is bound to her bed. Her door even has a sign on it which says: ""All unhappiness and world wisdom leave outside. Those without smiles need not enter."" [1] Stella has no idea a war is going on in the world and that there are poor and hungry people.
John Risca (Conway Tearle) is a well-known journalist and a friend of the family. He has been unhappily married to Louise for six years now and frequently visits Stella. John wants Stella to think he is perfect and lies about being unmarried. Louise, meanwhile, wants a servant in her house and hires orphan Unity Blake (also Mary Pickford). Unity is uneducated and has been deprived and mistreated for her entire life. This resulted in her being afraid of everyone.
One night, a drunk Louise orders Unity to get some groceries. Unity does what she is told and on her way back, the food is stolen by kids. She returns to the home only to be beaten by an outraged Louise. Unity is severely hurt and Louise gets arrested. It is announced she will have to serve three years in prison. John is kinder to Unity and adopts her. Unity is very grateful and falls in love with him. John himself is only interested in Stella. John wishes Unity to be raised at the Blount's residence, but they don't want her. They prevent her from meeting Stella, fearing Stella will notice there are suffering people in the world. They finally convince John to raise Unity at Aunt Gladys' house.
In order to make John fall in love with her, Unity starts to educate herself. Meanwhile, Stella gets an operation and is able to walk after three years. She meets John and they fall in love. One day she decides to give John a surprise visit. Louise, who has just been released from jail, opens the door and tells Stella the truth about her marriage. Stella is heartbroken upon learning that he lied to her about his marriage. Feeling betrayed, she tells John to leave her alone and refuses to talk to her family upon seeing how much sadness and pain are in the world.
Meanwhile, Unity uses one of John's suits and pretends he is asking her to marry him. When he comes home heartbroken over losing Stella, she tries to busy herself with work. As she hears Aunt Gladys' concerns about John's inability to be free to love Stella while Louise lives, Unity realizes she and John can never be a couple. At her relatives' home, Stella reconciles with them and comes to the realization that while there will be sadness and pain in the world, there are also joy and happiness that follows it. At Aunt Gladys' home, Unity writes him a note which she thanks him for showing her kindness and says he should get together with Stella. She secretly grabs a gun from a gun collection and settles the score by killing Louise for the pain she inflicted on herself, Stella and John. Unity next kills herself, making the police think it was a revenge murder as her troubled history is well known even to them. Aunt Gladys convinces Stella's wealthy relatives to give John another chance and not think badly about Unity for she helped free him from his abusive wife. John is reunited with Stella and they marry.",stella mari mari pickford born paralyz unabl walk wealthi guardian tri prevent expos bad happen world allow leav room london mansion bound bed door even sign say unhappi world wisdom leav outsid without smile need enter 1 stella idea war go world poor hungri peopl john risca conway tearl wellknown journalist friend famili unhappili marri louis six year frequent visit stella john want stella think perfect lie unmarri louis meanwhil want servant hous hire orphan uniti blake also mari pickford uniti uneduc depriv mistreat entir life result afraid everyon one night drunk louis order uniti get groceri uniti told way back food stolen kid return home beaten outrag louis uniti sever hurt louis get arrest announc serv three year prison john kinder uniti adopt uniti grate fall love john interest stella john wish uniti rais blount resid dont want prevent meet stella fear stella notic suffer peopl world final convinc john rais uniti aunt gladi hous order make john fall love uniti start educ meanwhil stella get oper abl walk three year meet john fall love one day decid give john surpris visit louis releas jail open door tell stella truth marriag stella heartbroken upon learn lie marriag feel betray tell john leav alon refus talk famili upon see much sad pain world meanwhil uniti use one john suit pretend ask marri come home heartbroken lose stella tri busi work hear aunt gladi concern john inabl free love stella louis live uniti realiz john never coupl rel home stella reconcil come realiz sad pain world also joy happi follow aunt gladi home uniti write note thank show kind say get togeth stella secretli grab gun gun collect settl score kill louis pain inflict stella john uniti next kill make polic think reveng murder troubl histori well known even aunt gladi convinc stella wealthi rel give john anoth chanc think badli uniti help free abus wife john reunit stella marri

YOU MUST NOT MISS
GERTRUDE McSKINNY

PLAY THE LITTLE LAUNDRESS
FIRST TIME HERE
TOMORROW AT 2PM

MISS SKINNY WILL UNDRESS HERE AT 2PM
The evening's entertainment arrives, first an extremely flexible dancer whom Fatty and Keaton feebly attempt to mimic. Next, a tall and egotistical, strongman who badly mistreats his assistant (Mahone). The staff attempt to defend the assistant but the strongman is so powerful that he is able to blow Fatty away using only his breath and does not even flinch when Keaton repeatedly hits him over the head with an axe. Eventually the staff manage to subdue the strongman by challenging him to prove his immense strength by lifting a heavy weight then electrocuting him.
That night the theater is completely full (due to the partially obscured sign) but due to his treatment earlier the strongman quits and takes the dancer with him forcing Fatty, Keaton and the assistant to plan an operetta, which they title ""The Falling Reign"", at short notice. Fatty and Keaton dress in drag and perform an elaborate dance act. The dancer who quit earlier is in the audience and frequently heckles the show but is soon dispatched when Keaton's dancing proves to energetic and launches him into the audience knocking the dancer out. The second act is a routine in which Fatty and Keaton are being covered with fake snow but the theater is so hot that Keaton has to fan himself and take off his coat, ruining the illusion. Things are made worse when the man slowly releasing the fake snow accidentally drops the whole bag onto Fatty, and during a scene where Fatty is serenading the assistant who sits in the window of the facade of a house, Keaton accidentally bumps into it knocking it over and causing it to fall towards Fatty but the open window fits neatly around his body saving him from harm.
Despite the show being a disaster, the audience nevertheless applaud and roar with laughter, believing the performers fumbles to be part of the act. The strongman, sitting in the audience, is outraged that his assistant is now a success. He produces a gun and shoots her before starting a brawl with the entire stage team. As Keaton and St John keep the strongman busy, Fatty loads a trunk full of weights and drops it on the strongman's head, knocking him out.

However, his mission is finally realized in his devotion to the ""broken blossom"" Lucy Burrows (Lillian Gish), the beautiful but unwanted and abused daughter of boxer Battling Burrows (Donald Crisp).
After being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in Cheng's home, the beautiful and exotic room above his shop. As Cheng nurses Lucy back to health, the two form a bond as two unwanted outcasts of society. All goes astray for them when Lucy's father gets wind of his daughter's whereabouts and in a drunken rage drags her back to their home to punish her. Fearing for her life, Lucy locks herself inside a closet to escape her contemptuous father.
By the time Cheng arrives to rescue Lucy, whom he so innocently adores, it is too late. Lucy's lifeless body lies on her modest bed as Battling has a drink in the other room. As Cheng gazes at Lucy's youthful face which, in spite of the circumstances, beams with innocence and even the slightest hint of a smile, Battling enters the room to make his escape. The two stand for a long while, exchanging spiteful glances, until Battling lunges for Cheng with a hatchet, and Cheng retaliates by shooting Burrows repeatedly with his handgun.

1919,The Delicious Little Devil,American,Robert Z. Leonard,"Mae Murray, Rudolph Valentino",comedy drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Delicious_Little_Devil,"Mary McGuire (Mae Murray) is a working-class young girl who lives in a New York tenement and supports her mother and her shiftless father and uncle.
Two items in the March 27, 1919 edition of The New York Star catch her attention. The first is a news item about the famous dancer Gloria du Moine going into hiding over a scandal involving her relationship with the Duke de Sauterne. (This was Murray in a thinly disguised portrayal obviously mimicking fellow real life dancer/star Gaby Deslys who had an affair with the King of Portugal before World War I). The second is a classified ad for the Peach Tree Inn, a nightspot that aims to be the ""snappiest roadhouse this side of Monte Carlo."" The Peach Tree's ad seeks a female hostess and dancer: ""A Good Future For A Girl With A Past.""
Mary applies for the job. To help cinch the deal, Mary tells Peach Tree manager Larry McKean (William V. Mong) that she's really Gloria du Moine. Larry asks her why she's dressed so shabbily. Mary replies that her servant absconded with all of her clothing, leaving her to wear the servant's clothes.
Mary—or rather, Gloria—gets the job, and the Peach Tree Inn promotes its grand opening night, featuring Gloria du Moine. In the audience for Gloria du Moine's Peach Tree opening night is Jimmy Calhoun (Rudolph Valentino), scion of the millionaire contractor Michael Calhoun (Edward Jobson). The young Calhoun meets Gloria and finds her enchanting. He tells his father he'd like to propose to her. Michael Calhoun arranges a small, private dinner party at the Peach Tree Inn in honor of Gloria. The elder Calhoun hopes that Gloria will make some sort of faux pas that will discourage his son from seeking her hand in marriage.
Meanwhile, the Duke de Sauterne (Bertram Grassby) has arrived in New York from Europe and noted the press announcements touting Gloria du Moine's performances at the Peach Tree Inn. The duke sets out to see her at the roadhouse, and his arrival coincides with Michael Calhoun's dinner party. The duke is escorted into Calhoun's private room. He gives no indication that Gloria du Moine is an imposter.
At sunrise, the dinner party guests are still at the Peach Tree Inn, sleeping off the drinks they consumed during the evening. Gloria/Mary wakes up and hurries upstairs to her lavish private suite. The duke also wakes up and follows her, and Jimmy follows him. Jimmy and the duke get into a fight, and the duke sends Jimmy tumbling down the staircase.
Mary runs outside, gets into a car and heads for her family's tenement apartment in New York City. The duke and Jimmy follow her separately in their own cars. The duke arrives first, follows Mary up the stairs to the apartment and forces his way in. He grabs Mary and tries to kiss her. Jimmy arrives and engages the duke in another fight. A detective arrives and apprehends the duke for deportation to Europe on accusations of being a swindler. Jimmy's father arrives, notes Mary's humble surroundings and grants his blessing for Jimmy to marry her.",mari mcguir mae murray workingclass young girl live new york tenement support mother shiftless father uncl two item march 27 1919 edit new york star catch attent first news item famou dancer gloria du moin go hide scandal involv relationship duke de sautern murray thinli disguis portray obvious mimick fellow real life dancerstar gabi desli affair king portug world war second classifi ad peach tree inn nightspot aim snappiest roadhous side mont carlo peach tree ad seek femal hostess dancer good futur girl past mari appli job help cinch deal mari tell peach tree manag larri mckean william v mong she realli gloria du moin larri ask she dress shabbili mari repli servant abscond cloth leav wear servant cloth mary—or rather gloria—get job peach tree inn promot grand open night featur gloria du moin audienc gloria du moin peach tree open night jimmi calhoun rudolph valentino scion millionair contractor michael calhoun edward jobson young calhoun meet gloria find enchant tell father hed like propos michael calhoun arrang small privat dinner parti peach tree inn honor gloria elder calhoun hope gloria make sort faux pa discourag son seek hand marriag meanwhil duke de sautern bertram grassbi arriv new york europ note press announc tout gloria du moin perform peach tree inn duke set see roadhous arriv coincid michael calhoun dinner parti duke escort calhoun privat room give indic gloria du moin impost sunris dinner parti guest still peach tree inn sleep drink consum even gloriamari wake hurri upstair lavish privat suit duke also wake follow jimmi follow jimmi duke get fight duke send jimmi tumbl staircas mari run outsid get car head famili tenement apart new york citi duke jimmi follow separ car duke arriv first follow mari stair apart forc way grab mari tri kiss jimmi arriv engag duke anoth fight detect arriv apprehend duke deport europ accus swindler jimmi father arriv note mari humbl surround grant bless jimmi marri

Although Sylvia favors Dr. Meade, she is proud of both of them. As Edward is putting on his uniform, the head of the children's hospital where he works comes to him and convinces him that his true duty lies there, where his surgeon's skill is most needed. Edward resigns his commission, and Sylvia, disgusted as what she perceives as cowardice, marries Richard the day he is leaving with his regiment for Europe. Richard conceals his hurt and devotes himself to the hospital. Betty Hoyt (Hawley), a friend of Sylvia, also hides her disappointment as she had feelings for Richard. Sylvia uses her time to aid poor families on New York's Lower East Side, and coming home one night runs down a little girl (Giraci) with her car, who turns out to be an orphan as her father had died at the front in Europe. Sylvia takes the child to recuperate in her home, and learns the child may never walk again. Seeking out the best surgeon, Sylvia finds the only one who has not gone to fight is Dr. Meade. Edward consents and does his best for the child. Meanwhile, Richard at the front line calmly faces possible death. He is wounded in battle, and finds that he has lost his right hand and severely injured the left side of his face. He then asks a friend to tell his wife that he had been killed in battle. Back in New York, Sylvia has come to better understand Edward's character as he cares for the orphan. When news of Richard's death comes, she turns to Edward, the man she has always loved.

Richard accepts this as he embraces her. Sylvia goes to see Edward at his home and finds him in his chair with the orphan on his lap.

1919,The Homesteader,American,Oscar Micheaux,Evelyn Preer,unknown,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Homesteader,"The Homesteader involves six principal characters, the leading one being Jean Baptiste (Charles Lucas), a homesteader far off in the Dakotas, living where he alone is black. To this wilderness arrives Jack Stewart, a Scotsman, with his motherless daughter, Agnes (Iris Hall). In Agnes, Baptiste meets the girl of his dreams. Agnes, however, does not know that she is not white. Peculiar fate threw her in the company of the Homesteader, but their love is forbidden by the custom of the country. Baptiste eventually sacrifices the love of this girl of his dreams, goes back to his own people and marries the daughter of a preacher.
McCarthy, the embodiment of vanity, deceit and hypocrisy, really admires the marriage his daughter has made. He speaks of the ""rich"" young man she has married, praises him to the highest. Baptiste does not know, however, that McCarthy requires and is in the habit of having people praise him. Baptiste does not do it because he is not of the temperament to do so. Because of this failure grows the tragedy of mismarriage to Orlean (Evelyn Preer), a sweet girl, kind and good, but like her mother, without the strength of her convictions.
Baptiste, Orlean having failed him, is persecuted by McCarthy and by Ethel (McCarthy's other daughter), who, like her father, possesses all the evil a woman is capable of; she is married to weak-kneed Glavis. In the end, Orlean, driven insane by the evil she had been the innocent cause of, rights a wrong which causes Baptiste to go back to his land in the Dakotas, where he finds the girl he first discovered.

1920,Convict 13,American,"Edward F. Cline, Buster Keaton","Buster Keaton, Joe Roberts",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict_13,"Buster, a particularly untalented golfer plays golf one morning with a group of friends. After a disastrous start he drives his ball into a nearby river but retrieves it after it is consumed by a fish. Meanwhile a convict escapes from a nearby prison and makes his way towards the golf course as the prison guards give chase. Buster's ball is once again stolen, this time by a dog who takes it a long way from the court. Buster accidentally knocks himself after his ball ricochets off of an equipment shed and while he is unconscious, the prisoner switches clothes with him. The guards give chase and Buster attempts to escape by jumping into a passing car but it turns out to belong to the warden. Though he hastily jumps into another car, he ends up going into the jail himself.
Reading the prisoner number on Buster's clothes he deduces that he is convict 13 who is scheduled to be hanged that very morning. Luckily Buster's girlfriend replaces the hangman's noose with a long elastic rope from the gym so that Buster bounces several times after the trapdoor is opened and he survives. The other prisoners are livid that they will not get to see an execution but the warden promises to hang two prisoners in the morning to make up for today's botched execution. Later that day Buster accidentally knocks out a prison guard whilst smashing rocks and steals his uniform in order to escape. At the same time a rowdy prisoner revolts in the prison yard and knocks out each of the guards one by one. Buster accidentally stumbles into the prisoner's path whilst escaping and the prisoner believes him to be another guard. Buster temporarily restrains the prisoner by closing the gate leading into the other yard but the prisoner quickly bends the bars of the gate and pursues Buster to the gallows where Buster restrains him by tying him up using the same elasticated noose used on him earlier.
Buster is ""promoted"" to Assistant Warden for his bravery but the now furious prisoner instigates a riot throughout the prison. The prisoner knocks out Buster, kidnaps his girlfriend and takes her out to the yard where the prisoners have completely overpowered the guards. Buster recovers and using a punching bag which he attaches to the elasticated rope, knocks out all of the rioting prisoners by swinging it around his head as they run around the yard. Buster celebrates but he accidentally knocks himself out when he leans on a sledgehammer which propels up and hits him in the head. However the scene then cuts back to Buster lying outside the equipment shed where he first knocked himself out being woken up by his girlfriend, the events of the short are all revealed to have been nothing more than a dream.",buster particularli untal golfer play golf one morn group friend disastr start drive ball nearbi river retriev consum fish meanwhil convict escap nearbi prison make way toward golf cours prison guard give chase buster ball stolen time dog take long way court buster accident knock ball ricochet equip shed unconsci prison switch cloth guard give chase buster attempt escap jump pass car turn belong warden though hastili jump anoth car end go jail read prison number buster cloth deduc convict 13 schedul hang morn luckili buster girlfriend replac hangman noos long elast rope gym buster bounc sever time trapdoor open surviv prison livid get see execut warden promis hang two prison morn make today botch execut later day buster accident knock prison guard whilst smash rock steal uniform order escap time rowdi prison revolt prison yard knock guard one one buster accident stumbl prison path whilst escap prison believ anoth guard buster temporarili restrain prison close gate lead yard prison quickli bend bar gate pursu buster gallow buster restrain tie use elast noos use earlier buster promot assist warden braveri furiou prison instig riot throughout prison prison knock buster kidnap girlfriend take yard prison complet overpow guard buster recov use punch bag attach elast rope knock riot prison swing around head run around yard buster celebr accident knock lean sledgehamm propel hit head howev scene cut back buster lie outsid equip shed first knock woken girlfriend event short reveal noth dream

1920,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,American,John S. Robertson,John Barrymore,horror,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde_(1920_film),"Henry Jekyll (John Barrymore) is a doctor of medicine, an idealist, and philanthropist. When he is not treating the poor in his free clinic, he is in his laboratory experimenting. Sir George Carew (Brandon Hurst), the father of his fiancée, Millicent (Martha Mansfield), is ""piqued"" by Dr. Jekyll. ""No man could be as good as he looks,"" Carew says. Following dinner one night, Carew taunts Dr. Jekyll in front of their friends, Edward Enfield (Cecil Clovelly), Dr. Lanyon (Charles Lane) and Utterson (J. Malcolm Dunn) proclaiming ""In devoting yourself to others, Jekyll, aren't you neglecting the development of your own life?"" ""Isn't it by serving others that one develops oneself?"" Jekyll replies. ""Which self?"" Carew retorts. ""Man has two - as he has two hands. Because I use my right hand, should I never use my left? Your really strong man fears nothing. It is the weak one who is afraid of experience. A man cannot destroy the savage in him by denying its impulses. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. With your youth, you should live - as I have lived. I have memories. What will you have at my age?""
And thus the seed is sown, and Jekyll begins his experiments. As he observes, ""Wouldn't it be marvellous if the two natures in man could be separated - housed in different bodies? Think what it would mean to yield to every evil impulse, yet leave the soul untouched!"" Finally, Jekyll develops a potion that turns him into a hideously evil creature that he calls Edward Hyde. As this creature, he is not recognizable as Dr. Jekyll, and, so, to facilitate the comings and goings of Hyde, he tells his servant, Poole (George Stevens), that Hyde is to have ""full authority and liberty about the house.""
Jekyll thus begins to live his double life. Hyde sets up a room in one of the seediest parts of London. He brings in a girl from the dance hall, Gina (Nita Naldi), to live with him there and frequents opium dens, dance halls, and bars - any place that satisfies his evil desires. Although Jekyll has developed a potion that will also return him to his original appearance and character as Dr. Jekyll, each time he takes the potion to become Edward Hyde, he worsens. He not only looks more evil, he becomes more evil, as well.
Millicent Carew is worried about the absence of her fiancé, so Sir George goes to call on Jekyll to see what is the matter. Although Jekyll is not home when he calls, Sir George encounters Hyde in the street just as he knocks a small boy to the ground injuring him. To make recompense for his actions, he goes and gets a check which he returns to the boy's father. Carew notices that the check has been signed by Dr. Jekyll. He confronts Poole who tells him the story of Edward Hyde.
In the meantime, Hyde/Jekyll has returned to the lab and, after drinking the potion, returns to his original self. Sir George finds him in the lab and demands to know his relationship with ""a vile thing like Hyde?""
""What right have you to question me - you who first tempted me?"" says Jekyll. Sir George angrily retorts that unless Jekyll is forthcoming with an explanation, he must object to his marriage to Millicent. This angers Jekyll to the point that he suddenly becomes Hyde, right in front of Sir George's eyes, without benefit of the potion. Sir George runs into the courtyard where Hyde catches him and clubs him to death with his walking stick. Hyde runs to his apartment and destroys any evidence that may link him to Jekyll. He eludes the police by only minutes and returns to his lab where he is able to drink the potion that restores him as Jekyll.
In the ensuing days, as Millicent grieves, Jekyll is tortured by his misdeeds. Soon, the drug needed to make the potion that will return him as Dr. Jekyll is depleted and cannot be found in all of London. Jekyll stays locked up in his lab fearing he may become Hyde at any moment. Millicent finally goes to see him, but just as she is about to enter the lab, he begins to transform into Hyde. Jekyll consumes the poison in the ring he took from the Italian dancer before he opens the door, fully transformed into Hyde. He lets her in, locks the door and grabs her in his arms. Suddenly, he starts convulsing. Millicent runs from the lab and when Lanyon comes in, he finds Hyde sitting in a chair, having just died, and his appearance returned to that of Dr. Jekyll. He discerns that Jekyll committed suicide, and calls the others (Poole, Utterson and Millicent) in, but declares to them that Hyde has killed Dr. Jekyll. In the final shot, Millicent is grieving next to the body of Dr. Jekyll.",henri jekyl john barrymor doctor medicin idealist philanthropist treat poor free clinic laboratori experi sir georg carew brandon hurst father fiancé millic martha mansfield piqu dr jekyl man could good look carew say follow dinner one night carew taunt dr jekyl front friend edward enfield cecil clovelli dr lanyon charl lane utterson j malcolm dunn proclaim devot other jekyl arent neglect develop life isnt serv other one develop oneself jekyl repli self carew retort man two two hand use right hand never use left realli strong man fear noth weak one afraid experi man destroy savag deni impuls way get rid temptat yield youth live live memori age thu seed sown jekyl begin experi observ wouldnt marvel two natur man could separ hous differ bodi think would mean yield everi evil impuls yet leav soul untouch final jekyl develop potion turn hideous evil creatur call edward hyde creatur recogniz dr jekyl facilit come go hyde tell servant pool georg steven hyde full author liberti hous jekyl thu begin live doubl life hyde set room one seediest part london bring girl danc hall gina nita naldi live frequent opium den danc hall bar place satisfi evil desir although jekyl develop potion also return origin appear charact dr jekyl time take potion becom edward hyde worsen look evil becom evil well millic carew worri absenc fiancé sir georg goe call jekyl see matter although jekyl home call sir georg encount hyde street knock small boy ground injur make recompens action goe get check return boy father carew notic check sign dr jekyl confront pool tell stori edward hyde meantim hydejekyl return lab drink potion return origin self sir georg find lab demand know relationship vile thing like hyde right question first tempt say jekyl sir georg angrili retort unless jekyl forthcom explan must object marriag millic anger jekyl point suddenli becom hyde right front sir georg eye without benefit potion sir georg run courtyard hyde catch club death walk stick hyde run apart destroy evid may link jekyl elud polic minut return lab abl drink potion restor jekyl ensu day millic griev jekyl tortur misde soon drug need make potion return dr jekyl deplet found london jekyl stay lock lab fear may becom hyde moment millic final goe see enter lab begin transform hyde jekyl consum poison ring took italian dancer open door fulli transform hyde let lock door grab arm suddenli start convuls millic run lab lanyon come find hyde sit chair die appear return dr jekyl discern jekyl commit suicid call other pool utterson millic declar hyde kill dr jekyl final shot millic griev next bodi dr jekyl

1920,Haunted Spooks,American,"Alfred J. Goulding, Hal Roach",Harold Lloyd,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunted_Spooks,"The action in Haunted Spooks centres around Harold's romantic problems. It is set in the South (""[go] down the Mississippi and turn to the right"").
The opening sequence has an uncle reading a telegram regarding a will. It tells him that his niece Mildred will inherit the house and plantation provided she lives there for a year with her husband. He tells his wife that they must scare them out of the house. A lawyer visits the niece to tell her of the will. She tells him she isn't married and he says he can resolve the problem.
We then jump to Harold who is disappointed in love and vying for the attention of the Other Girl in rivalry with her other potential suitor. They compete to be first to ask her father for her hand in marriage. Harold wins but when he returns to the girl she is in the arms of yet a third man, so he gives up. He then tries, with notable lack of success, to commit suicide. Firstly using a gun he finds on a path, which turns out to be a water-pistol; then standing in front of a tram, which takes a sudden turn; then he ties a rock around his neck and jumps off a low bridge into a lake, but this fails as it is only inches deep; he then picks a second bridge, but lands in a boat; and finally stands in front of a car, which stops in time, but contains the lawyer from the earlier scene. He takes Harold to Mildred and arranges their marriage.
They then drive off to the mansion, with some jokes en route: the gesticulating passengers in the car in front appear to be signalling right then left, preventing overtaking; the birds in the back seat pecking his head.
They reach the mansion and the uncle plays a series of tricks to make the house appear haunted. A series of people appear in white sheets and covered in flour until the prank is uncovered. In a more unusual prank a pair of trousers walk on their own, having a little black boy inside. We see Harold's hair stand on end then fall.

1920,Huckleberry Finn,American,William Desmond Taylor,"Lewis Sargent, Wallace Beery",adventure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huckleberry_Finn_(1920_film),"As described in a film publication,[2] Huckleberry Finn (Sargent) has been adopted by the Widow Douglas (K. Griffith) who plans to ""civilize"" him. With Tom Sawyer (G. Griffith) he forms a robber gang, and in a cave has the local boys take an oath to stick together. In his bedroom he runs into his no-account father (Lanning) who steals Huck's small change and later kidnaps Huck, taking him in a small boat down the river, while Tom and the gang wait for their leader to appear. Huck later escapes from a cabin where his father mistreated him, making it look as if he drowned while getting away in a canoe.
Rumors of Huck's death spreads. Jim (Reed), the widow's slave boy, hears that he is to be sold and runs off, and joins Huck on a raft. Duke (Humphrey) and King (Bates), two broken-down actors fleeing a crowd they had fooled with a mock theatrical performance, join them. At the next town the actors again fool the people with a pretend theatrical performance with Huck acting as the doorkeeper. Further downstream the actors then impersonate the brothers of a deceased man named Wilks in an attempt to obtain the inheritance, but Huck takes the money to keep it from the actors after he is smitten by the daughter, Mary Jane Wilks (Ralston). Huck and Jim leave to escape the wrath of their former companions just as the actual relatives of the dead man show up.
After peace is made when King and Duke rejoin the group, a shabby trick is performed when King sells Jim to a man named Phelps and then tells Huck that Jim has been lost. Upon learning the truth, Huck sets out to rescue his friend. He discovers that Mrs. Phelps (Moore) is the sister of Tom's Aunt Polly. Huck poses as the nephew Tom, whom Mrs. Phelps has never met. Then the real Tom arrives, who is surprised as he believed that Huck had died. After exchanging signals, Tom poses as his brother Sid and they go through with a plan.

1920,The Last of the Mohicans,American,"Clarence Brown, Maurice Tourneur",Wallace Beery,adventure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_(1920_American_film),"In 1757, in the midst of the French and Indian War, three French divisions and their Huron Indian allies are advancing on Fort William Henry, a British stronghold south of Lake George in the colony of New York. Chingachgook (Theodore Lorch) sends his son Uncas (Roscoe), the last living warrior of the Mohican tribe, to warn the fort's commander, Colonel Munro (James Gordon), of the imminent danger. Uncas is admired by Munro's daughter Cora (Barbara Bedford), much to the displeasure of her suitor, Captain Randolph (George Hackathorne).
Munro dispatches Major Heyward (Henry Woodward) and an Indian runner named Magua (Beery) to escort Cora and her ""capricious"" younger sister Alice (Hall) to the relative safety of Fort Edward, and to deliver an urgent request for reinforcements to its commander, General Webb (Sydney Deane). Magua, who is a Huron sympathizer with ulterior motives, convinces Heyward to take a ""shortcut"" through a forest, then pretends to lose his way. In the forest they encounter Uncas, Chingachgook and the hunter and scout Hawkeye (Harry Lorraine), accompanied by an eccentric preacher named David Gamut (Nelson McDowell). When Heyward asks for directions to Fort Edward, the men become suspicious of Magua who, like all Indians in the area, should have an intimate knowledge of the terrain. Their fears of treachery are confirmed when they discover that Magua has disappeared.
Uncas and Hawkeye conceal Heyward and the women in a cave, but Magua and his men find the hiding place, and after a fierce firefight the women are captured. Magua offers to spare ""Golden Hair"" (Alice) if Cora will become his squaw; but Uncas, Chingachgook and Hawkeye counterattack and rescue the hostages. Although they leave Magua for dead, he is actually uninjured.
At Fort William Henry the situation is dire. The only thing keeping the besiegers at bay is a formidable gun emplacement on the left rampart. The cowardly Captain Randolph informs Montcalm, the French commander, that the rampart guns are nonfunctional, leaving Munro no choice but to surrender the fort. Though promised safe passage for the women and children, the Hurons, under the influence of French-supplied whiskey, slaughter the civilians and torch the fort.
Magua kidnaps the Munro sisters for a second time and flees. Uncas and Hawkeye pursue him, but Magua reaches a neutral Delaware village. The dispute is taken before a Delaware council of three; their judgment is that Cora be released to Uncas, and that Alice remain with Magua. To save her sister, Cora offers to take her place. Uncas vows that Magua will not leave with his true love; but by Delaware law, Magua is protected until sundown.
That night, Cora escapes and is pursued by Magua to the edge of a precipice. She threatens to jump if he approaches, so Magua waits patiently for her to fall asleep. When she does, he grabs her arm. She flings herself off the cliff, but Magua still has hold of her arms. When Uncas appears, the situation is reversed: Cora tries to save herself, but Magua uses his knife to pry her fingers loose, and she falls to her death. In the ensuing fight, Magua stabs Uncas, whose body rolls down the embankment to rest near Cora's. With his final, dying strength, Uncas reaches forth and takes Cora's hand in his. Magua flees when Chingachgook and Hawkeye arrive, but Hawkeye shoots him dead.
At Cora and Uncas's burial ceremony, Chingachgook mourns the passing of his son, the last of the Mohicans.",1757 midst french indian war three french divis huron indian alli advanc fort william henri british stronghold south lake georg coloni new york chingachgook theodor lorch send son unca rosco last live warrior mohican tribe warn fort command colonel munro jame gordon immin danger unca admir munro daughter cora barbara bedford much displeasur suitor captain randolph georg hackathorn munro dispatch major heyward henri woodward indian runner name magua beeri escort cora caprici younger sister alic hall rel safeti fort edward deliv urgent request reinforc command gener webb sydney dean magua huron sympath ulterior motiv convinc heyward take shortcut forest pretend lose way forest encount unca chingachgook hunter scout hawkey harri lorrain accompani eccentr preacher name david gamut nelson mcdowel heyward ask direct fort edward men becom suspici magua like indian area intim knowledg terrain fear treacheri confirm discov magua disappear unca hawkey conceal heyward women cave magua men find hide place fierc firefight women captur magua offer spare golden hair alic cora becom squaw unca chingachgook hawkey counterattack rescu hostag although leav magua dead actual uninjur fort william henri situat dire thing keep besieg bay formid gun emplac left rampart cowardli captain randolph inform montcalm french command rampart gun nonfunct leav munro choic surrend fort though promis safe passag women children huron influenc frenchsuppli whiskey slaughter civilian torch fort magua kidnap munro sister second time flee unca hawkey pursu magua reach neutral delawar villag disput taken delawar council three judgment cora releas unca alic remain magua save sister cora offer take place unca vow magua leav true love delawar law magua protect sundown night cora escap pursu magua edg precipic threaten jump approach magua wait patient fall asleep grab arm fling cliff magua still hold arm unca appear situat revers cora tri save magua use knife pri finger loos fall death ensu fight magua stab unca whose bodi roll embank rest near cora final die strength unca reach forth take cora hand magua flee chingachgook hawkey arriv hawkey shoot dead cora uncass burial ceremoni chingachgook mourn pass son last mohican

1920,Pollyanna,American,Paul Powell,Howard Ralston,drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollyanna_(1920_film),"The film opens in the Ozarks where a distraught Pollyanna (Mary Pickford) is comforting her father the Reverend John Whittier (Wharton James) as he dies. After his death Pollyanna is sent to live on a New England plantation with her Victorian Aunt Polly (Katherine Griffith).
Aunt Polly is cold and uncaring to Pollyanna: not picking her up at the station, giving her a sparse room in the attic, and scolding at her every chance she gets. As the days pass Pollyanna's antics amuse the servants, but not Aunt Polly.
One day while playing on the plantation, Pollyanna gets in trouble with a servant woman and runs to hide in a haystack. There she meets Jimmy Bean (Howard Ralston), an orphan her age. Taking pity on him, Pollyanna is certain eventually Aunt Polly will let him live with them. So she hides him in the cellar. One day Aunt Polly insists in going in the cellar despite Pollyanna's pleas for fear Jimmy will be discovered. Jimmy is asleep and Pollyanna believes they're in the clear; until Jimmy starts shouting in his sleep, having a bad dream about turnips chasing and trying to eat him. Pollyanna is amused but Aunt Polly is not. After some pleading, Aunt Polly relents and tells Pollyanna to bring some good quilts for Jimmy.
One day, as Jimmy and Pollyanna play with the other children, they decide to try and steal some apples from a tree belonging to John Pendleton (William Cortleigh). John catches Pollyanna in the act, but forgives her, realizing she is the exact image of her mother, a woman he once loved deeply, but who left him to marry the man who eventually became Pollyanna's father. He tells Pollyanna this as he shows her a painting of her mother. Meanwhile Jimmy fights his way in, fearing that Pollyanna is in danger. He tries to defend her but finds that everything is normal.
As Pollyanna settles in she seems to bring optimism to those she meets. She is insistent on playing a game her father taught her called 'The Glad Game', where one counts the things they are glad for. She visits an old shut-in who is supposedly grateful for nothing. Pollyanna brings along an old blind and deaf friend who plays the accordion. Upon discovering the woman is blind and deaf, the shut-in proclaims her gratitude for still having her sight and hearing.
One day after a fight with Jimmy in which he 'wishes she would die', Pollyanna heads into town. She notices a little girl playing in the middle of the road, oblivious to a car coming. Pollyanna leaps in front of the car, throwing the girl to safety, but in the process is hit herself. Jimmy and John both take her back to her Aunt's place. Aunt Polly becomes frantic and places her in her own lavish bedroom. Realizing the error of her ways, Aunt Polly declares how attached to Pollyanna she is; even giving her a kiss on the forehead, much to Pollyanna's delight.
Realizing they could have lost the little girl forever, many succumb to her wishes for them to be happy. John promises to adopt Jimmy the next day. Aunt Polly refuses to call Dr. Tom, (Herbert Prior), who broke her heart years before. Pollyanna pleads to send for him but she refuses, bringing in another doctor. After several days, they discover Pollyanna is paralyzed from the waist down. Pollyanna becomes distraught; however Jimmy comforts her, insisting she play the Glad Game.
Months pass and Pollyanna begins to use a wheelchair. One evening with Aunt Polly, she pleads one last time for her to send for Dr. Tom and Aunt Polly finally relents. With the help of Dr. Tom, Pollyanna is eventually able to walk again.
With the success of her walking comes the realization of her wishes. Aunt Polly reunites romantically with Dr. Tom; and Jimmy is happily living with John. One day she asks for Jimmy and he comes to wheel her around the garden. He gives Pollyanna a ring and promptly runs off out of fear, not realizing Pollyanna is able to walk. She is excited at the ring and happily runs after him.",film open ozark distraught pollyanna mari pickford comfort father reverend john whittier wharton jame die death pollyanna sent live new england plantat victorian aunt polli katherin griffith aunt polli cold uncar pollyanna pick station give spars room attic scold everi chanc get day pass pollyanna antic amus servant aunt polli one day play plantat pollyanna get troubl servant woman run hide haystack meet jimmi bean howard ralston orphan age take piti pollyanna certain eventu aunt polli let live hide cellar one day aunt polli insist go cellar despit pollyanna plea fear jimmi discov jimmi asleep pollyanna believ theyr clear jimmi start shout sleep bad dream turnip chase tri eat pollyanna amus aunt polli plead aunt polli relent tell pollyanna bring good quilt jimmi one day jimmi pollyanna play children decid tri steal appl tree belong john pendleton william cortleigh john catch pollyanna act forgiv realiz exact imag mother woman love deepli left marri man eventu becam pollyanna father tell pollyanna show paint mother meanwhil jimmi fight way fear pollyanna danger tri defend find everyth normal pollyanna settl seem bring optim meet insist play game father taught call glad game one count thing glad visit old shutin supposedli grate noth pollyanna bring along old blind deaf friend play accordion upon discov woman blind deaf shutin proclaim gratitud still sight hear one day fight jimmi wish would die pollyanna head town notic littl girl play middl road oblivi car come pollyanna leap front car throw girl safeti process hit jimmi john take back aunt place aunt polli becom frantic place lavish bedroom realiz error way aunt polli declar attach pollyanna even give kiss forehead much pollyanna delight realiz could lost littl girl forev mani succumb wish happi john promis adopt jimmi next day aunt polli refus call dr tom herbert prior broke heart year pollyanna plead send refus bring anoth doctor sever day discov pollyanna paralyz waist pollyanna becom distraught howev jimmi comfort insist play glad game month pass pollyanna begin use wheelchair one even aunt polli plead one last time send dr tom aunt polli final relent help dr tom pollyanna eventu abl walk success walk come realiz wish aunt polli reunit romant dr tom jimmi happili live john one day ask jimmi come wheel around garden give pollyanna ring promptli run fear realiz pollyanna abl walk excit ring happili run

In fact, Bertie is feigning this behavior because he believes it will help to impress the girl of his dreams, his adopted sister Agnes. Unfortunately, it helps him to do nothing more than get disowned by his father.
Bertie's sister, Rose, is married to an unsuccessful lawyer named Mark, who is admired by Van Alstyne but in fact is a troublemaker. He has a mistress named Henrietta and an illegitimate child with her. When Henrietta dies after a long illness, a letter is sent to him informing him about the present circumstances. Mark manages to claim the letter is actually Bertie's, breaking Agnes' heart and ensuring Van Alstyne never wants to speak to his son again.
Soon after, when Van Alstyne goes away on business he leaves Mark in charge of running the family's finances, but Mark plots to claim the family fortunes himself by selling off all their shares of stock. Bertie inadvertently saves the day by buying back all of the stock without realizing what he is doing. When Van Alstyne sees what has happened he forgives Bertie and allows him to marry Agnes. Mark, meanwhile, conveniently dies of a heart attack when he realizes that his scheme has failed.

1920,Sex,American,Fred Niblo,"Louise Glaum, Irving Cummings",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_(film),"The film is a morality story on the evils of marital infidelity and the wild lifestyle of New York actors. At the same time, the film included scenes of seduction and debauchery that made it the subject of controversy over its prurient content.
The film's plot centers on Adrienne Renault (played by Louise Glaum), the beautiful queen of the Midnight Follies at the Frivolity Theater.
The film opens with Renault's current conquest, a married millionaire, Philip Overman (played by William Conklin). Overman is in his private box watching Renault perform her seductive ""Spider Dance"". Renault comes on stage dressed as a spider, ""clad in a translucent cloak of webs wrapped cloak-like around a body-hugging black sheath"".[2]
In another scene of debauchery, the film depicts a party at which ""stage-door johnnies drink out of women's slippers and scantily clad chorines slide down banisters, their undergarments visible to all and sundry"".[2][3]
The film then shifts to Mrs. Overman (played by Myrtle Stedman), home alone in her empty mansion. Her suspicions persuade her to hire a private detective to follow her husband. Eventually, Mrs. Overman uncovers her husband's infidelity. She begs Renault to release her husband, but Renault refuses, and Mrs. Overman obtains a divorce.
By this time, Renault has fallen in love with a new millionaire, Dick Wallace (played by Irving Cummings). Renault marries Wallace, but Wallace then betrays Renault, falling in love with Renault's young protege, Daisy (played by Viola Barry). It was Renault who had coached Daisy in the ways of seducing wealthy married men. Renault begs Daisy to release Wallace, harkening back to the scene where Mrs. Overmire had pleaded with Renault. As Renault had done with Mrs. Overman, Daisy refuses to release Wallace.
Renault then sails for Europe. She ends up on the same ship with the reunited Overmans, who are on a second honeymoon. The chastened Renault does nothing to disrupt the relationship, resigned to a life of solitude. The film's final intertitle reads, ""The standards of morality eternally demand that the naked soul of Sex be stripped of its falsehoods – which can only be atoned for through bitter tears.""[2][3]",film moral stori evil marit infidel wild lifestyl new york actor time film includ scene seduct debaucheri made subject controversi prurient content film plot center adrienn renault play louis glaum beauti queen midnight folli frivol theater film open renault current conquest marri millionair philip overman play william conklin overman privat box watch renault perform seduct spider danc renault come stage dress spider clad transluc cloak web wrap cloaklik around bodyhug black sheath2 anoth scene debaucheri film depict parti stagedoor johnni drink women slipper scantili clad chorin slide banist undergar visibl sundry23 film shift mr overman play myrtl stedman home alon empti mansion suspicion persuad hire privat detect follow husband eventu mr overman uncov husband infidel beg renault releas husband renault refus mr overman obtain divorc time renault fallen love new millionair dick wallac play irv cum renault marri wallac wallac betray renault fall love renault young proteg daisi play viola barri renault coach daisi way seduc wealthi marri men renault beg daisi releas wallac harken back scene mr overmir plead renault renault done mr overman daisi refus releas wallac renault sail europ end ship reunit overman second honeymoon chasten renault noth disrupt relationship resign life solitud film final intertitl read standard moral etern demand nake soul sex strip falsehood – aton bitter tears23

One afternoon Amanda gets in trouble again and is forced to work all night long. All alone, she fantasizes about her first and only meeting with Horace, eight months ago. All the fellow employees ridicule her for still having faith that he will return someday to pick up his clothes. Amanda is fed up with all her colleagues making fun of her and lies that she is a duchess, coming from a wealthy family. She comes up with a story of her having an affair with Horace. Her father found out and sent her to live in London.
Meanwhile, co-worker Benjamin Jones (Harold Goodwin) has the job of collecting laundry with his cart. One day, his beloved horse Lavender is too weak to go up a hill and falls. The cart is destroyed and when Benjamin admits the truth to Madame Didier, she asks for the horse to be killed. Benjamin reveals to Amanda what will happen with Lavender and she tries to stop the horse from being killed. She eventually buys the horse and takes it into her own home.
Amanda is not allowed to take the horse into her own apartment and is noticed on the streets by the wealthy and sympathizing Lady Burke-Cavendish. She offers to take the horse to live at her country place. Amanda is delighted and accepts her offer. Later, Lady Burke-Cavendish stops by to tell Amanda the horse is doing very well. Amanda lies to the fellow laundry women Lady Burke-Cavendish is actually her aunt.
They are interrupted by Horace: he has returned for his laundry. The fellow workers assume he will recognize Amanda, since they were lied to he is her secret lover. Amanda is desperate and successfully pretends to be reunited with him. Horace is confused and wants to leave. While the laundry women are away she tells the truth to Horace. Benjamin walks in on them, initially trying to flirt with Amanda, but when he notices Horace's presence he leaves.
Horace sympathizes with Amanda and invites her to his mansion. He changes his mind when he becomes ashamed of her. Amanda notices this and pulls back. Horace leaves and Amanda is left behind with a broken heart. She is later hired as Lady Burke-Cavendish's personal maid and now lives in wealth. She finds out Horace is a worker at the country place and they fall in love with each other.",amanda afflick mari pickford poor laundri woman work london weak hard work alway pick humili boss madam didier rose dion amanda desper love handsom custom horac greensmith albert austin none colleagu think stand chanc sweetheart one afternoon amanda get troubl forc work night long alon fantas first meet horac eight month ago fellow employe ridicul still faith return someday pick cloth amanda fed colleagu make fun lie duchess come wealthi famili come stori affair horac father found sent live london meanwhil cowork benjamin jone harold goodwin job collect laundri cart one day belov hors lavend weak go hill fall cart destroy benjamin admit truth madam didier ask hors kill benjamin reveal amanda happen lavend tri stop hors kill eventu buy hors take home amanda allow take hors apart notic street wealthi sympath ladi burkecavendish offer take hors live countri place amanda delight accept offer later ladi burkecavendish stop tell amanda hors well amanda lie fellow laundri women ladi burkecavendish actual aunt interrupt horac return laundri fellow worker assum recogn amanda sinc lie secret lover amanda desper success pretend reunit horac confus want leav laundri women away tell truth horac benjamin walk initi tri flirt amanda notic horac presenc leav horac sympath amanda invit mansion chang mind becom asham amanda notic pull back horac leav amanda left behind broken heart later hire ladi burkecavendish person maid live wealth find horac worker countri place fall love

1920,Why Change Your Wife?,American,Cecil B. DeMille,"Gloria Swanson, Thomas Meighan, Bebe Daniels",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Change_Your_Wife%3F,"Frumpy wife Beth devotes herself to bettering her husband's mind and expanding his appreciation for the finer things in life, such as classical music. When he goes shopping at a lingerie store to buy some sexier clothes for her, he meets Sally, the shop girl. Rejected by his wife for a night out on the town, he takes Sally, who douses him with her perfume. When Beth smells another woman's perfume, she kicks him out and files for divorce.
Beth's Aunt Kate takes her shopping to get her mind off of her broken heart. While in the dress shop, Beth overhears women gossiping about how her dull appearance led to her losing her husband. She determines to ""play their game"" and gets a new ""indecent"" wardrobe. Meanwhile the manipulative Sally convinces the dejected Robert to marry her. He finds that his second wife annoys him as much as his previous one.
Later the couple and their dog end up at the same luxury hotel where divorcee Beth is strutting her stuff. She tries to seduce Robert, but he resists. Each of them quickly leaves the situation, but they meet again on a train. As they're walking away from the station, Robert slips on a banana peel. When the police arrive on the scene, Beth identifies Robert as her husband and takes him home. Doctors say he is to be kept quiet for 24 hours.
The two women argue over whether Sally will move Robert against doctor's orders. Beth locks the three of them into the bedroom, which leads to a physical struggle over the key during which Sally breaks a mirror, inviting seven years bad luck. Beth threatens to burn Sally's face with acid, which leads to a stalemate. The three stay in the room until Robert's crisis is over. A doctor pronounces him healthy, but Robert refuses to go home with Sally. Sally throws the vial of acid on Beth's face only to discover that Beth was bluffing; the vial contained only eye wash.
Sally leaves but not before taking the cash from Robert's pants pockets and declaring that the best thing about marriage is alimony.
The final scenes show the remarried Robert and Beth in their home. Beth dresses up in more revealing clothes and replaces the classical recording on her Victrola with a record of the foxtrot. Sally has taken up with a violin player. The intertitle that ends the film reassures ladies that their husbands would prefer them as sweethearts, and reminds them to make sure they remember, from time to time, to ""forget"" being a wife.",frumpi wife beth devot better husband mind expand appreci finer thing life classic music goe shop lingeri store buy sexier cloth meet salli shop girl reject wife night town take salli dous perfum beth smell anoth woman perfum kick file divorc beth aunt kate take shop get mind broken heart dress shop beth overhear women gossip dull appear led lose husband determin play game get new indec wardrob meanwhil manipul salli convinc deject robert marri find second wife annoy much previou one later coupl dog end luxuri hotel divorce beth strut stuff tri seduc robert resist quickli leav situat meet train theyr walk away station robert slip banana peel polic arriv scene beth identifi robert husband take home doctor say kept quiet 24 hour two women argu whether salli move robert doctor order beth lock three bedroom lead physic struggl key salli break mirror invit seven year bad luck beth threaten burn salli face acid lead stalem three stay room robert crisi doctor pronounc healthi robert refus go home salli salli throw vial acid beth face discov beth bluf vial contain eye wash salli leav take cash robert pant pocket declar best thing marriag alimoni final scene show remarri robert beth home beth dress reveal cloth replac classic record victrola record foxtrot salli taken violin player intertitl end film reassur ladi husband would prefer sweetheart remind make sure rememb time time forget wife

Landry is waiting for the return of Conrad as they plan to marry. Alma also loves Conrad, and would like Sylvia to marry her brother-in-law Larry, a gambler and criminal. Alma arranges for Sylvia to be caught in a compromising situation by Conrad when he returns. He leaves for Brazil, and Larry kills a man during a game of poker. Sylvia returns to the South.
Landry meets Rev. Jacobs, a minister who runs a rural school for black children called Piney Woods School. The school was overcrowded, and he cannot continue on the small amount offered to blacks for education by the state. With the school facing closure, Landry volunteers to return to the North to raise $5,000.
She has difficulty raising the money needed to save the school so she heads to Boston. However her purse is stolen when she arrives. A local man, Dr. Vivian chases after the thief and recovers her purse. After being hit by a car that stemmed from saving a young child playing in the street, Landry meets the owner of the car as she recovers in the hospital. The owner is Elena Warwick, a wealthy philanthropist. Learning of Sylvia's mission, she decides to give her the needed money. When her Southern friend Mrs. Stratton tries to discourage her, Warwick increases her donation to $50,000. This amount will save the school and Landry returns to the South.
Meanwhile, Dr. Vivian has fallen in love with Sylvia. He goes to Alma, who tells him about Sylvia's past: these flashback scenes are portrayed in the film. Sylvia was adopted and raised by a poor black family, the Landrys, who managed to provide her with an education.
During her youth, the senior Landry was wrongfully accused of the murder of an unpopular but wealthy white landlord, Gridlestone.

Sylvia escaped after being chased by Gridlestone's brother, who was close to raping her. Noticing a scar on her breast, Gridlestone's brother realized that Sylvia was his mixed-race daughter, born of his marriage to a local black woman. He had paid for her education.
After hearing about her life, Dr. Vivian meets with Sylvia; he encourages her to love her country and take pride in the contributions of African Americans. He professes his love for her, and the film ends with their marriage.",film open sylvia landri evelyn preer young africanamerican woman visit cousin alma north landri wait return conrad plan marri alma also love conrad would like sylvia marri brotherinlaw larri gambler crimin alma arrang sylvia caught compromis situat conrad return leav brazil larri kill man game poker sylvia return south landri meet rev jacob minist run rural school black children call piney wood school school overcrowd continu small amount offer black educ state school face closur landri volunt return north rais 5000 difficulti rais money need save school head boston howev purs stolen arriv local man dr vivian chase thief recov purs hit car stem save young child play street landri meet owner car recov hospit owner elena warwick wealthi philanthropist learn sylvia mission decid give need money southern friend mr stratton tri discourag warwick increas donat 50000 amount save school landri return south meanwhil dr vivian fallen love sylvia goe alma tell sylvia past flashback scene portray film sylvia adopt rais poor black famili landri manag provid educ youth senior landri wrong accus murder unpopular wealthi white landlord gridleston white mob attack landri famili lynch parent hunt son escap nearli shot mob also lynch efrem servant gridleston sylvia escap chase gridleston brother close rape notic scar breast gridleston brother realiz sylvia mixedrac daughter born marriag local black woman paid educ hear life dr vivian meet sylvia encourag love countri take pride contribut african american profess love film end marriag

1921,The Blot,American,"Phillips Smalley, Lois Weber",Claire Windsor,melodrama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blot,"At the end of class, poorly paid college professor Andrew Griggs begs his unruly students to show more appreciation for his efforts to teach them. Among the most disrespectful are a spoiled trio led by Phil West (Louis Calhern), whose father is the school's wealthiest trustee; Bert Gareth, a congressman's son; and Walt Lucas, a 23-year-old who must graduate to receive his inheritance.
Unbeknownst to his friends, Phil's interest has been piqued by the professor's daughter, Amelia (Claire Windsor). He frequently drops by the public library where she works, just to be able to speak to her. She, however, is unimpressed by him and his wealth.
The Griggs' poverty is contrasted with the prosperity of their next-door neighbors. ""Foreign-born"" shoemaker Hans Olsen is sympathetic to their plight, as is his eldest son Peter (Amelia's secret admirer), but his wife strongly dislikes what she considers Mrs. Griggs' superior airs.
One day, Phil finally manages to persuade Amelia to let him drive her home after work, as it is raining (and her shoe has a hole in it). He is invited inside. Mrs. Griggs, knowing who he is, decides to spend what little she has on some fancy sandwiches, cakes and tea in an attempt to put up a brave front. She is heartbroken to find when she brings them in that Phil has departed and poor Reverend Gates (another of Amelia's admirers) is to be the recipient of her expensive bounty. As a result, Mrs. Griggs is unable to make the mortgage payment on the house.
Juanita Claredon (Marie Walcamp), another of the country club set, considers herself Phil's girl. Noting a change in the now more thoughtful and considerate man, she follows him one day to the library and sees her rival. Eventually, she realizes that his love for Amelia has matured him, and wishes him well.
When Amelia becomes sick, the doctor recommends she get some nourishing food, such as chicken. Mrs. Griggs tries unsuccessfully to buy one on credit (a scene observed by Phil). In desperation, she steals an uncooked chicken from Mrs. Olsen's open window; this is witnessed by the horrified Amelia. While Amelia does not see her mother change her mind and put it back, Mrs. Olsen and Peter do. When Mrs. Olsen threatens to make this theft known, Peter insists he will leave home if she does. Meanwhile, Phil sends anonymously a basket of food (including a chicken) to the Griggs. However, Amelia refuses to eat it, as she believes it was stolen.
The next day, though she is still ill, she goes to work, as it is payday. Afterward, she goes to apologize to Mrs. Olsen and to pay for the theft. Her teary attempt to make amends moves her neighbor, who denies she lost a chicken. The strain is too much for Amelia; she faints. Phil and Mrs. Griggs rush over and take her home. There, Phil confesses it was he who sent the chicken. Amelia is finally won over.
Phil writes his father about the inadequate salaries paid to the teachers, calling it a ""blot on the present day civilization""; impressed, Philip West Sr. comes to see his altered son and agrees that something must be done. In the meantime, Phil dragoons his friends into paying the professor for extra tutoring in the evenings. During that night's session, both Peter and Gates see that Amelia has given her heart to Phil. In the final scene, the saddened reverend congratulates them and makes his way home.",end class poorli paid colleg professor andrew grigg beg unruli student show appreci effort teach among disrespect spoil trio led phil west loui calhern whose father school wealthiest truste bert gareth congressman son walt luca 23yearold must graduat receiv inherit unbeknownst friend phil interest piqu professor daughter amelia clair windsor frequent drop public librari work abl speak howev unimpress wealth grigg poverti contrast prosper nextdoor neighbor foreignborn shoemak han olsen sympathet plight eldest son peter amelia secret admir wife strongli dislik consid mr grigg superior air one day phil final manag persuad amelia let drive home work rain shoe hole invit insid mr grigg know decid spend littl fanci sandwich cake tea attempt put brave front heartbroken find bring phil depart poor reverend gate anoth amelia admir recipi expens bounti result mr grigg unabl make mortgag payment hous juanita claredon mari walcamp anoth countri club set consid phil girl note chang thought consider man follow one day librari see rival eventu realiz love amelia matur wish well amelia becom sick doctor recommend get nourish food chicken mr grigg tri unsuccess buy one credit scene observ phil desper steal uncook chicken mr olsen open window wit horrifi amelia amelia see mother chang mind put back mr olsen peter mr olsen threaten make theft known peter insist leav home meanwhil phil send anonym basket food includ chicken grigg howev amelia refus eat believ stolen next day though still ill goe work payday afterward goe apolog mr olsen pay theft teari attempt make amend move neighbor deni lost chicken strain much amelia faint phil mr grigg rush take home phil confess sent chicken amelia final phil write father inadequ salari paid teacher call blot present day civil impress philip west sr come see alter son agre someth must done meantim phil dragoon friend pay professor extra tutor even night session peter gate see amelia given heart phil final scene sadden reverend congratul make way home
1921,The Boat,American,"Edward F. Cline, Buster Keaton",Buster Keaton,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boat_(1921_film),"Buster is married with two children (both of whom wear the porkpie hat made famous by Keaton). He has built a large boat he has christened Damfino inside his home. When he finishes and decides to take the boat out to sea, he discovers it is too large to fit through the door. Buster enlarges the opening a bit, but when he tows the boat out, it proves to be a bit bigger than he estimated, and the house collapses, utterly.
Buster loses his car during the attempt to launch the boat. The boat passes with impunity under the exceedingly low bridges of the Venice (California) canals thanks to Buster's boat design. While out on the Pacific, Buster and his family are caught in a terrible storm. The boat is barely seaworthy to begin with, and it does not help that Buster nails a picture up inside the boat, causing an improbable leak, or when he further drills through the bottom of the boat to let the water out (resulting in a spectacular gusher of a leak). He radios a Morse Code call for help, but when the navy or coast guard operator asks who it is, he answers, ""d-a-m-f-i-n-o"" (in Morse Code).

Marguerite is constantly surrounded by suitors, whom she entertains at her lavish apartment. She also has consumption and is frequently beset by bouts of illness.
Armand sees Marguerite at the opera and, later, pursues her when he attends one of her private parties. She rejects his advances at first, but eventually returns his affection.
The two live happily together until Armand's father, seeking to protect his family's reputation, convinces Marguerite to end the relationship. She finally relents and runs away to a wealthy client, leaving a note for Armand.

He is particularly fond of his grandson Julio (Rudolph Valentino), with whom he often carouses at seedy dives in the Boca district of Buenos Aires. In one of these bars, the movie's famous tango sequence occurs. A man and a woman (Beatrice Dominguez) are dancing the tango. Julio strides up and asks to cut in. The woman stares at Julio alluringly. The man brushes him off, and they resume dancing. Julio then challenges the man and strikes him, knocking him into some tables and out of the scene. Julio and the woman then dance a dramatic version of the tango that brings cheers from the people in the establishment. Following the dance, the woman sits on Julio's lap. Madariaga then slides to the floor, drunk. The woman laughs at Madariaga. Julio casts her aside in scorn and helps his grandfather home.
Sometime later, Madariaga dies. The extended family breaks up, one half returning to Germany and the other to France.
In Paris, Julio enjoys a somewhat shiftless life as a would-be artist and sensation at the local tea dances. He falls in love with Marguerite Laurier (Alice Terry), the unhappy and much younger wife (by an arranged marriage) of Etienne Laurier, a friend of Julio's father. The affair is discovered, and Marguerite's husband agrees to give her a divorce to avoid a scandal. It seems as though Julio and Marguerite will be able to marry, but both end up getting caught up in the start of the Great War.
Marguerite becomes a nurse in Lourdes. The bravery of Etienne is reported, and he is blinded in battle. Etienne happens to end up at the hospital where she is working, and Marguerite attends to him there. Julio travels to Lourdes to see Marguerite and instead sees her taking care of Etienne. Julio, ashamed of his wastrel life, enlists in the French Army.
In the meantime, the German Army overruns Julio's father Marcelo's Marne Valley castle in the First Battle of the Marne. Marcelo is forced to host a German general and staff in the castle. One of Marcelo's three German nephews is amongst the staff and tries to protect him, but Marcelo is arrested after a melee involving an officer's assault of a woman. Marcello is to be executed in the morning, but his life is spared when the French Army counterattacks in the ""Miracle of the Marne"". The castle is destroyed by the French counterattack.
Four years later Julio has survived and become renowned for his bravery in the trenches at the front. During a mission in no man's land, he encounters his last surviving German cousin. Moments later, they are both killed by a shell. Back in Paris, Marguerite considers abandoning the blinded Etienne, but Julio's ghost guides her to continue her care for him.
The ending scene shows Marcelo Desnoyers mourning over his son's grave. The man who lived upstairs from Julio watches over him. Marcelo asks him, ""Did you know my son?"" The man, with a remorseful expression, lifts his arms, forming the shape of a cross with his body, and says ""I knew them all!"" He then points to the sky and shows Marcelo the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse riding away into the clouds. With this, the man assures him that ""Peace has come—but the Four Horsemen will still ravage humanity—stirring unrest in the world—until all hatred is dead and only love reigns in the heart of mankind.""",madariaga centaur pomeroy cannon harsh popular argentin landown german soninlaw dislik french one whose famili openli favor particularli fond grandson julio rudolph valentino often carous seedi dive boca district bueno air one bar movi famou tango sequenc occur man woman beatric dominguez danc tango julio stride ask cut woman stare julio alluringli man brush resum danc julio challeng man strike knock tabl scene julio woman danc dramat version tango bring cheer peopl establish follow danc woman sit julio lap madariaga slide floor drunk woman laugh madariaga julio cast asid scorn help grandfath home sometim later madariaga die extend famili break one half return germani franc pari julio enjoy somewhat shiftless life wouldb artist sensat local tea danc fall love marguerit laurier alic terri unhappi much younger wife arrang marriag etienn laurier friend julio father affair discov marguerit husband agre give divorc avoid scandal seem though julio marguerit abl marri end get caught start great war marguerit becom nurs lourd braveri etienn report blind battl etienn happen end hospit work marguerit attend julio travel lourd see marguerit instead see take care etienn julio asham wastrel life enlist french armi meantim german armi overrun julio father marcelo marn valley castl first battl marn marcelo forc host german gener staff castl one marcelo three german nephew amongst staff tri protect marcelo arrest mele involv offic assault woman marcello execut morn life spare french armi counterattack miracl marn castl destroy french counterattack four year later julio surviv becom renown braveri trench front mission man land encount last surviv german cousin moment later kill shell back pari marguerit consid abandon blind etienn julio ghost guid continu care end scene show marcelo desnoy mourn son grave man live upstair julio watch marcelo ask know son man remors express lift arm form shape cross bodi say knew point sky show marcelo four horsemen apocalyps ride away cloud man assur peac come—but four horsemen still ravag humanity—stir unrest world—until hatr dead love reign heart mankind

Seeing that the photographer is looking away, Dan moves his head to the side and snaps a picture of Buster without anybody noticing. Thus, when Dan escapes, the wanted posters all show Buster with his hands on the bars. Unaware, Buster moves on to a street corner, where he notices a horseshoe, and kicks it aside. The next man who comes along picks it up and throws it for good luck. Within seconds the man finds a wallet filled with money. After scrambling to find the horseshoe, Buster picks it up and throws over his shoulder. It strikes a policeman, who chases Buster, and soon other officers join the chase. Buster lures them into the back of a truck, locks them in, and escapes.
Afterwards, Buster sees a man arguing with a young woman. Buster defends the woman and throws the man to the ground. After walking away, Buster runs into the officers who had chased him earlier.

The townspeople run from him in terror wherever he goes.
Buster is once again in the wrong place at the wrong time when the police chief on his patrol is ambushed by a gangster. The gunman's bullets miss the officer, but the smoking gun ends up in Buster's hand. He runs from the persistent police chief, inadvertently causing mischief all over the town. While on the run, Buster encounters the same young woman he assisted earlier, who invites him to dinner. At her home he meets her father—he is the police chief, and he furiously chases Buster all over the apartment complex. After the young woman helps Buster escape, the pair emerge onto the street where Buster observes a sign outside a furniture store that says ""You furnish the Girl, we furnish the home!""

1921,Little Lord Fauntleroy,American,Jack Pickford,Mary Pickford,comedy drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Lord_Fauntleroy,"In a shabby New York City side street in the mid-1880s, young Cedric Errol lives with his mother (known only as Mrs. Errol or ""Dearest"") in genteel poverty after the death of his father, Captain Cedric Errol. One day, they are visited by an English lawyer named Havisham with a message from young Cedric's grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt, an unruly millionaire who despises the United States and was very disappointed when his youngest son married an American woman. With the deaths of his father's elder brothers, Cedric has now inherited the title Lord Fauntleroy and is the heir to the earldom and a vast estate. Cedric's grandfather wants him to live in England and be educated as an English aristocrat. He offers his son's widow a house and guaranteed income, but he refuses to have anything to do with her, even after she declines his money.
However, the Earl is impressed by the appearance and intelligence of his American grandson and is charmed by his innocent nature. Cedric believes his grandfather to be an honorable man and benefactor, and the Earl cannot disappoint him. The Earl therefore becomes a benefactor to his tenants, to their delight, though he takes care to let them know that their benefactor is the child, Lord Fauntleroy.
Meanwhile, back in New York, a homeless bootblack named Dick Tipton tells Cedric's old friend Mr. Hobbs, a New York City grocer, that a few years prior, after the death of his parents, Dick's older brother Benjamin married an awful woman who got rid of their only child together after he was born and then left. Benjamin moved to California to open a cattle ranch while Dick ended up in the streets. At the same time, a neglected pretender to Cedric's inheritance appears in England, the pretender's mother claiming that he is the offspring of the Earl's eldest son, Cedric, Sr.. The claim is investigated by Dick and Benjamin, who come to England and recognize the woman as Benjamin's former wife. She flees, and the Tipton brothers and the pretender, Benjamin's son, do not see her again.

She promises Louise that she will not marry until Louise can look upon her husband to approve him. Lustful aristocrat de Praille (whose carriage kills a child, enraging peasant father, Forget-not) meets the two outside Paris. Taken by the virginal Henriette's beauty, he has her abducted and brought to his estate where a lavish party is being held, leaving Louise helpless in the big city. An honorable aristocrat, the Chevalier de Vaudrey helps Henriette to escape de Praille and his guests by successfully fighting a duel with him. The scoundrel Mother Frochard, seeing an opportunity to make money, tricks Louise into her underground house to be kept prisoner. Unable to find Louise with the help of the Chevalier, Henriette rents a room, but before leaving her de Vaudrey comforts and kisses the distressed woman. Later, Henriette gives shelter to admirable politician Danton, who after an attack by Royalist spies following a public speech falls for her. As a result, she runs foul of the radical revolutionary Robespierre, a friend of Danton.
Mother Frochard forces Louise into begging. Meanwhile, de Vaudrey proposes to Henriette and she refuses. After expressing love for each other, he promises Henriette that Louise will be found. King Louis XVI orders Henriette to be arrested, due to his disapproval of de Vaudrey's choice of wife, and the Chevalier is also sent away while his aunt visits Henriette. During the meeting, Louise is heard singing outside, where Frochard has told her to walk blindly and sing. Henriette calls out from her upstairs balcony, but the panicked Louise is dragged off by Frochard and Henriette is arrested and sent to a women's prison.
Louise and Frochard's begging continues with the other two Frochards, and before long the Revolution begins. A battle between the Royalist soldiers and the people allied with the police, who are successful, results in aristocrats being killed and the prisoners of the ""Tyrants"" (including Henriette) being freed. A people's 'rag-tag' government is formed, and Forget-not takes his revenge against de Praille.
Robespierre and Forget-not send Henriette and her lover, the Chevalier de Vaudrey, to the guillotine, for hiding de Vaudrey, an aristocrat, who returned to Paris to find her. However, Danton manages to obtain a pardon for them. After a race through the streets of Paris he just manages to save Henriette and offers her to the Chevalier, when the two orphans unite.

1921,The Playhouse,American,"Edward F. Cline, Buster Keaton","Buster Keaton, Virginia Fox, Joe Roberts, Edward F. Cline",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Playhouse_(film),"The film is set up as a series of humorous tricks on the audience, with constant doubling, and in which things are rarely what they at first seem to be. It opens with Keaton attending a variety show. In this first sequence, Keaton plays beside him and remarks, ""This fellow Keaton seems to be the whole show."" This was a gibe at one of Keaton's contemporaries, Thomas Ince, who credited himself generously in his film productions.[1] In interviews with Kevin Brownlow,[2] Keaton claims he gave the director's credit to Cline mainly because he did not want to appear too Ince-like himself: ""Having kidded things like that, I hesitated to put my own name on as a director and writer.""
This elaborate trick-photography sequence turns out to be only a dream when Joe Roberts rouses Keaton from bed. The bedroom then turns out to be not a bedroom, but a set on a stage.
The second half of the film features Keaton's character falling for a girl who happens to be a twin. He has difficulty telling the twin who likes him from the one who does not. An uncredited Virginia Fox plays one of the twins. Edward F.

The Boy sees a recruiting poster and applies to join the United States Navy. When the magnate decides to take a long cruise on his yacht, he tells his daughter to bring along her friends. She invites the Boy, but he finds he cannot get out of his three-year enlistment.
Aboard ship, he makes an enemy of intimidating sailor ""Rough-House"" O'Rafferty (Noah Young), but when O'Rafferty throws a box at the Boy and strikes a passing officer, the Boy steps up and accepts the blame. He and O'Rafferty then become good friends.
The Girl and her friends stop off at the port of Agar Shahar Khairpura, the ""City of a Thousand Rascals"", in the country of Khairpura-Bhandanna, to sightsee, just as the Boy and O'Rafferty get shore leave there.

The potentate has her kidnapped and taken to his palace. The Boy rushes to her rescue and single-handedly manages to outwit the Maharajah and his guards and escape with the Girl.
Later, the Boy uses signal flags from his ship to ask with the Girl on her father's yacht, ""Will you?""

The next morning, he is awakened by a loud noise. His valet John, while chasing his pretty maid, has broken his mirror. John claims Mary, the maid, dropped a napkin. By the time Max drags himself out of bed, Mary has cleared away the broken glass and John has gotten Max's chef to dress just like their employer. Then, when Max looks into the non-existent glass, the chef mimics his every action. Max finally realizes he is being tricked, but while he is in the other room, John sneaks in a repairman to fix the mirror. Thus when Max flings something at what he thinks is an imposter, he breaks the mirror himself, much to his surprise. Now he fears he has brought seven years bad luck on himself (a well-known superstition).
He goes to see Betty, his fiancée. While waiting, he has her maid (a psychic) read his palm. She warns him that she sees danger in the form of a dog, so he takes Betty's small pet and sticks it in a vase. When Betty sees what he has done, she breaks up with him.
She reconsiders and asks him to come back, but when he does, he has to wait for her once again. He first puts on a record, then dances with her maid, and finally starts wildly playing the piano. His nonchalant behavior infuriates Betty, and she sends him packing again.

1921,The Sheik,American,George Melford,"Rudolph Valentino, Agnes Ayres","drama, adventure",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheik_(film),"In the North Africa town of Biskra, headstrong Lady Diana Mayo (Agnes Ayres) refuses a marriage proposal because she believes it would be the end of her independence. Against her brother's wishes, she is planning a month-long trip into the desert, escorted only by natives.
When Diana goes to the local casino, she is informed it has been appropriated for the evening by an important sheik, and that none but Arabs may enter. Annoyed at being told what she cannot do, and her curiosity piqued, Diana borrows an Arab dancer's costume and sneaks in. Inside, she finds men gambling for new wives. When she is selected to be the next prize, she resists. Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan (Rudolph Valentino) intervenes, then realizes she is white. Amused, he sends her away. Afterward, Mustapha Ali (Charles Brinley) informs the Sheik she is the woman he has been hired to guide tomorrow. The Sheik hatches a plan. Early the next morning, he sneaks into her room and tampers with the bullets in her revolver as she is sleeping.
As her brother leaves her to her desert excursion, she assures him he will see her in London next month. The Sheik and his men come upon Diana riding alone. She tries to flee while shooting at the Sheik, but he easily captures her. Back at his encampment, he orders her about. She is unused to such treatment, but the Sheik tells her she will learn and demands she dress like a woman (she is wearing pants) for dinner.
Diana tries again to escape, this time into a raging sand storm. The Sheik saves her from certain death, and tells her she will learn to love him. Later, he finds Diana alone in her quarters weeping. The Sheik considers forcing himself upon her, but decides against it and calls for a serving girl, Zilah (Ruth Miller). Zilah offers her a hug. Diana accepts, and pours out her tears in Zilah's arms.
After a week, the Sheik is delighted by the news that his close friend from his days in Paris, where he was educated, is coming for a visit. Diana is dismayed at the thought of being seen in Arab dress by a Westerner, but the Sheik does not understand her shame. He does, however, return her gowns before his friend comes so she can wear them to dinner. When she is introduced to writer and doctor Raoul St. Hubert (Adolphe Menjou), Diana's spirit is nearly broken. He befriends her and reprimands the Sheik for his callous treatment of her. The Sheik returns her Western clothing, though he refuses to release her.
When Raoul is called away to tend to an injured man, Diana shows concern that it might be the Sheik. Seeing this from hiding, the Sheik is elated that she may be warming up to him at last. He gives Diana her gun back, telling her he trusts her.
Diana is allowed to go into the desert under the watchful eye of the Sheik's French valet Gaston (Lucien Littlefield). She escapes. Making her way across the sands, she spots a caravan, unaware that it belongs to the bandit Omair (Walter Long). Fortunately, the Sheik and his men reach her first.
The Sheik reveals to Raoul he is in love with Diana; his friend convinces him to let her go. Meanwhile, Diana is allowed out once more. She playfully writes ""I love you Ahmed"" in the sand. Then Omair's band captures her, killing her guards and leaving the wounded Gaston for dead.
When the Sheik goes looking for Diana, he sees her message, then learns from Gaston who has abducted her. He gathers his men to attack Omair's stronghold. Omair tries to force himself on Diana, but is almost stabbed by one of his women. Then the Sheik and his men sweep in. After a long fight, the Sheik kills Omair, but is himself gravely injured.
Raoul tends to him and tells Diana he has a chance. She sits and holds the Sheik's hand. When she remarks that his hand is big for an Arab, Raoul reveals that the Sheik is not one. His father was British and his mother Spanish. They died in the desert, and their child was rescued and raised by the old Sheik; when the old man died, Ahmed returned to rule the tribe. When Ahmed wakes up, Diana confesses her love.",north africa town biskra headstrong ladi diana mayo agn ayr refus marriag propos believ would end independ brother wish plan monthlong trip desert escort nativ diana goe local casino inform appropri even import sheik none arab may enter annoy told curios piqu diana borrow arab dancer costum sneak insid find men gambl new wive select next prize resist sheik ahm ben hassan rudolph valentino interven realiz white amus send away afterward mustapha ali charl brinley inform sheik woman hire guid tomorrow sheik hatch plan earli next morn sneak room tamper bullet revolv sleep brother leav desert excurs assur see london next month sheik men come upon diana ride alon tri flee shoot sheik easili captur back encamp order unus treatment sheik tell learn demand dress like woman wear pant dinner diana tri escap time rage sand storm sheik save certain death tell learn love later find diana alon quarter weep sheik consid forc upon decid call serv girl zilah ruth miller zilah offer hug diana accept pour tear zilah arm week sheik delight news close friend day pari educ come visit diana dismay thought seen arab dress western sheik understand shame howev return gown friend come wear dinner introduc writer doctor raoul st hubert adolph menjou diana spirit nearli broken befriend reprimand sheik callou treatment sheik return western cloth though refus releas raoul call away tend injur man diana show concern might sheik see hide sheik elat may warm last give diana gun back tell trust diana allow go desert watch eye sheik french valet gaston lucien littlefield escap make way across sand spot caravan unawar belong bandit omair walter long fortun sheik men reach first sheik reveal raoul love diana friend convinc let go meanwhil diana allow play write love ahm sand omair band captur kill guard leav wound gaston dead sheik goe look diana see messag learn gaston abduct gather men attack omair stronghold omair tri forc diana almost stab one women sheik men sweep long fight sheik kill omair grave injur raoul tend tell diana chanc sit hold sheik hand remark hand big arab raoul reveal sheik one father british mother spanish die desert child rescu rais old sheik old man die ahm return rule tribe ahm wake diana confess love

Francis), a retired guardsman on a modest pension, has to support three daughters: Theodora (Swanson) and her older half-sisters. Theodora's sisters pin their hopes on her marrying a wealthy man.
One day, Theodora goes out on a rowboat off the coast of Dorset and falls into the water. She is rescued by Lord Hector Bracondale (Valentino). He is young, handsome and wealthy, but ""not the marrying kind"". Out of a sense of duty to her beloved father, she reluctantly agrees to wed the middle-aged, short, stout Josiah Brown (Robert Bolder), a former grocer's assistant who is now a multi-millionaire.
They honeymoon in the Alps. By coincidence, Bracondale stops at the same inn. Rich American widow Jane McBride (Mabel Van Buren) persuades the young bride to accompany her on a climbing excursion. Theodora slips and dangles precariously by her safety line over a cliff. Bracondale appears and climbs down to her, but they are too heavy for the others to pull up. Bracondale has them lower him and Theodora to a ledge below. While they wait for more help to arrive, Theodora tells Bracondale (who does not initially recognize her) where they last met.
They meet a third time in Paris, and finally acknowledge their love for each other. However, Theodora refuses to run away with Bracondale.
Bracondale strives to do the right thing. He asks his sister, Lady Anningford (June Elvidge), to befriend Theodora. Lady Anningford invites the Browns to her country estate. Bracondale, however, cannot stay away. He tries once again to persuade Theodora to change her mind, without success. Meanwhile, Josiah is persuaded by another guest, renowned explorer Sir Lionel Grey, to fund his dangerous expedition. Bracondale leaves, and Josiah is called away on business. Theodora writes a letter to each; to Bracondale, she declares her love, but stresses once more that it cannot be fulfilled. Morella Winmarleigh (Gertrude Astor), who desires Bracondale for herself, secretly opens the letters and, after perusing them, switches them.
After Bracondale reads the message meant for Josiah, he rushes to stop Josiah from reading his, but is too late. Josiah accuses Bracondale of stealing his wife, but the nobleman denies that Theodora has been unfaithful.

1922,A Blind Bargain,American,Wallace Worsley,"Lon Chaney, Raymond McKee",horror,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Blind_Bargain,"The film is a contemporary (1920s, though the book was published in 1897) picture that takes place in New York City. The story involves a mad scientist who turns circumstances on a young man to do his bidding.
Robert Sandell (Raymond McKee), despondent over his bad luck as a writer and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb (Lon Chaney), a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell (Virginia True Boardman) on one consideration – that Robert shall, at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees.
Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife (Fontaine La Rue) and a grotesque hunchback (Lon Chaney, in a dual role), whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments.
Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter Angela (Jacqueline Logan) and promptly falls in love.
In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners – previously failed experiments of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain, for his book has been published and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, the hunchback releases a cage door, and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments.
Finally freed from the terms of his ""blind bargain"", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.",film contemporari 1920 though book publish 1897 pictur take place new york citi stori involv mad scientist turn circumst young man bid robert sandel raymond mckee despond bad luck writer mother declin health attack attempt rob theatergo dr lamb lon chaney sinist fanat physician live suburb new york lamb take boy home learn stori agre perform oper mr sandel virginia true boardman one consider – robert shall end eight day deliv doctor experiment purpos frantic worri die mother condit robert agre mother son take resid lamb home robert close watch doctor wife fontain la rue grotesqu hunchback lon chaney dual role robert learn afterward result one doctor experi dr lamb anxiou keep hold robert give spend money assist book publish wytcherli head publish compani robert meet wytcherli daughter angela jacquelin logan promptli fall love meantim day slip time experi robert warn mr lamb hunchback great danger threaten dawn show warn mysteri underground vault complet oper room tunnel cage strang prison – previous fail experi lamb agoni fear robert goe physician tri buy bargain book publish success writer yet one day time limit doctor realiz victim may tri escap seiz strap oper tabl rescu mr lamb hunchback releas cage door doctor brought horribl end hand apeman wreck mental doctor experi final freed term blind bargain robert return home learn write met success angela wait marriag ceremoni

He has set up shop in Monte Carlo and his partners in crime (and possible lovers) are his cousins: ""Princess"" Vera Petchnikoff (Busch) and ""Her Highness"" Olga Petchnikoff (George).
Count Karamzin begins his latest scam on the unworldly wife of an American envoy, Helen Hughes (DuPont), even though her husband is nearby. He attempts to charm her, planning to eventually fleece her of her money. She is easily impressed by his faux-aristocratic glamor, to the chagrin of her dull but sincere husband. Karamzin also has his eye on two other women, Maruschka (Fuller), a maid at the hotel, and Marietta (Polo) the mentally disabled daughter of one of his criminal associates (Gravina), seeing them both as easy sexual prey.

Karamzin jumps to save himself, leaving Mrs Hughes in danger. She is saved, and is looked after by her devoted husband. Karamzin's public display of selfish cowardice ensures he is shunned by the high society he craves to be accepted by.

1922,The Frozen North,American,Buster Keaton,Buster Keaton,unknown,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frozen_North,"The film opens near the ""last stop on the subway"", a terminal in Alaska, which appears to be emerging from deep snow in the middle of nowhere. A tough-looking cowboy (Buster Keaton) emerges. He arrives at a small settlement, finding people gambling in a saloon. He tries to rob them by scaring them with the cutout of a poster of a man holding a gun, which he places at the window, as if he has an accomplice. He tells the gamblers to raise their hands in the air. Frightened, they hand over their cash, but soon they find out the truth when a drunk man falls over the cutout. Keaton is thrown out through the window.
Next, he mistakenly enters a house thinking that it is his own house. Inside, he sees a man and a woman kissing. Thinking the woman is his wife, he gets red-hot angry and shoots the couple, later to realize his mistake. He goes to his own house, where he finds his wife (Sybil Seely), who greets him, but he treats her coldly. She tries to pick a vase from a shelf, but it drops and knocks her out. Investigating the shooting of the couple, a passing policeman then knocks at Keaton's door after hearing his wife scream. Keaton saves himself from arrest by playing music on gramophone and pretending to dance with his unconscious wife. As soon as the officer leaves, he drops her on the floor.
He looks out of the window and sees his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill). He quickly dons an elegant white suit and picks flowers (mysteriously growing from the deep snow; a sign reads ""Keep Off the Grass""). He attempts to woo her, but she rejects him. Her husband comes back home and Keaton's character has to flee once more.
The neighbors leave on a sled for a new, even more bleak northerly location. Keaton gets a ""car"" (a dog sled with an engine) driven by a friend (Joe Roberts) to follow them, but it breaks down, so he has to hail a passing ""taxi"" (a horse drawn sled with upholstery). The taxi is stopped by a traffic warden riding a motorized sled with a propeller for speeding on the snow, but they get away. Keaton is up to his old tricks—he ""reverses"" the propeller so the officer goes backward into a lake. Near the north pole, he and Roberts find a hotel-like igloo with wall-hangings of a stag's head and a guitar. In a gag Keaton tries to hang his hat on a stag head antler but it keeps falling off. They attempt to survive by fishing in the manner of the Eskimos. Keaton makes snow-shoes from guitars and attempts to catch fish using tinned sardines as bait, but just creates trouble—he first falls through the ice and then tries to fish—but the only things he ""catches"" are another fisherman's baited fish and the other fisherman himself!
Forced to flee back to the igloo, where his companion is hoovering the ice floor, Keaton sees his pretty neighbor again in her new hut. Fortified by drinking a bottle of cola, he decides he will force himself on her in the manner of Erich von Stroheim's character from the film Foolish Wives. He appears in Stroheim-like clothing at her hut, but is chased by her husband. Pretending to be a snowman, he eludes him and returns to the hut. Roberts tries to fight the husband but ends up falling into a lake. The husband returns to find his wife weeping on the floor as Keaton stands over her. He wrestles with Keaton. Keaton's wife appears and shoots her husband. The wounded Keaton takes a pistol and tries to shoot the husband, but at that moment a janitor wakes Keaton up in the front row of a film theater (the gun in the last scene turns out to be a folded newspaper in his hand) and Keaton realizes that it was all a dream!",film open near last stop subway termin alaska appear emerg deep snow middl nowher toughlook cowboy buster keaton emerg arriv small settlement find peopl gambl saloon tri rob scare cutout poster man hold gun place window accomplic tell gambler rais hand air frighten hand cash soon find truth drunk man fall cutout keaton thrown window next mistakenli enter hous think hous insid see man woman kiss think woman wife get redhot angri shoot coupl later realiz mistak goe hous find wife sybil seeli greet treat coldli tri pick vase shelf drop knock investig shoot coupl pass policeman knock keaton door hear wife scream keaton save arrest play music gramophon pretend danc unconsci wife soon offic leav drop floor look window see pretti neighbor bonni hill quickli don eleg white suit pick flower mysteri grow deep snow sign read keep grass attempt woo reject husband come back home keaton charact flee neighbor leav sled new even bleak northerli locat keaton get car dog sled engin driven friend joe robert follow break hail pass taxi hors drawn sled upholsteri taxi stop traffic warden ride motor sled propel speed snow get away keaton old tricks—h revers propel offic goe backward lake near north pole robert find hotellik igloo wallhang stag head guitar gag keaton tri hang hat stag head antler keep fall attempt surviv fish manner eskimo keaton make snowsho guitar attempt catch fish use tin sardin bait creat trouble—h first fall ice tri fish—but thing catch anoth fisherman bait fish fisherman forc flee back igloo companion hoover ice floor keaton see pretti neighbor new hut fortifi drink bottl cola decid forc manner erich von stroheim charact film foolish wive appear stroheimlik cloth hut chase husband pretend snowman elud return hut robert tri fight husband end fall lake husband return find wife weep floor keaton stand wrestl keaton keaton wife appear shoot husband wound keaton take pistol tri shoot husband moment janitor wake keaton front row film theater gun last scene turn fold newspap hand keaton realiz dream

Moran, it is clear, adores her father. She has grown up on and around ships and can handle herself on the water as well as any man.
Then scene then shifts to San Francisco, where a young socialite, Ramon Laredo, complains that he is tired of the same tiresome round of parties and dances. He wishes he could get away from it all. While on his way to a yachting party, he meets up with an old sailor. After talking, they repair to a saloon, where Ramon is served a Mickey Finn. After passing out, he is shanghaied aboard a nefarious pirating ship, the ""Heart of China,"" run by Captain Kitchell, a man without principles. Though initially dismissed as a pampered weakling by the crew and captain, Ramon proves his manhood and gradually gains everyone's respect.
A Scandinavian ship in distress is spotted off the bow; the pirate crew quickly move in to loot the burning ship. Most of the crew, they discover, is dead, victims of leaking coal gas. Ramon rescues one sailor, whom he carries back to the pirate ship, only to discover that ""he"" is a ""she."" It is Moran, of course, whose father has perished aboard the burning ship. Efforts to hide her identify are futile; when Captain Kitchell discovers a female is on board, it is clear that the woman's virginity is endangered. Ramon, however, is determined to protect her. Gradually, Ramon and Moran fall in love, though Moran insists at first that she has no interest in romance—she should have been born a boy, she says. After a lively battle on board the ship—crew vs. captain and his henchmen—the ship reaches the port in San Diego.
Disembarking, Ramon finds himself at a high-society party attended by vacationing San Franciscans. They are delighted to see him and urge him to rejoin their company. But Ramon makes it clear that his experience of recent months has changed him, has made him a better man.

1922,The Prisoner of Zenda,American,Rex Ingram,Lewis Stone,swashbuckler,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner_of_Zenda_(1922_film),"Englishman Rudolf Rassendyll (Lewis Stone) decides to pass the time by attending the coronation of his distant relation, King Rudolf V of Ruritania (also played by Stone) . He encounters an acquaintance on the train there, Antoinette de Mauban (Barbara La Marr), the mistress of the king's treacherous brother, Grand Duke 'Black' Michael (Stuart Holmes).
The day before the coronation, Rassendyll is seen by Colonel Sapt (Robert Edeson) and Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim (Malcolm McGregor). Astounded by the uncanny resemblance between Rassendyll and their liege, they take him to meet Rudolf at a hunting lodge. The king is delighted with his double and invites him to dinner. During the meal, a servant brings in a fine bottle of wine, a present from Michael delivered by his henchman, Rupert of Hentzau (Ramon Novarro). After Rudolf tastes it, he finds it so irresistible that he drinks the entire bottle by himself.
The next morning, Sapt is unable to rouse him; the wine was drugged. Sapt is afraid that if the coronation is postponed, Michael will seize the throne. The country is dangerously divided between the supporters of Rudolf and of Michael. The colonel declares that it is Fate that brought Rassendyll to Ruritania; he can take Rudolf's place with no one the wiser. The Englishman is less certain, but he tosses a coin, which lands in Rudolf's favor, and Rassendyll goes through with the ceremony. Afterwards, he is driven to the palace in the company of the universally adored Princess Flavia (Alice Terry).
Later, when Rassendyll returns to the lodge to switch places with the king once more, he and Sapt find only the corpse of Josef (Snitz Edwards), the servant left to guard the king. Rassendyll is forced to continue the masquerade.
With Rudolf guarded by a handful of trusted retainers at Zenda Castle, Michael tries unsuccessfully to bribe Rassendyll into leaving. In the days that follow, Rasssendyll becomes acquainted with Flavia, and the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Rupert tries to alienate Antoinette from Michael by telling her that Michael will marry Flavia once Rudolf is out of the way. However, it has an unintended effect; Antionette reveals Michael's plans and Rudolf's location to von Tarlenheim.
A dwarf assassin (John George) in Michael's pay tries to garrot Rassendyll, but Sapt interrupts him before he can finish the job. The would-be killer mistakenly signals to an anxiously waiting Michael that the deed is done, and the duke hastens to Zenda to quietly dispose of the real king. However, Rassendyll was only rendered unconscious. When von Tarlenheim arrives with his news, the three men chase after Michael.
Sapt and von Tarlenheim split up to find a way into the castle, but when Antoinette lowers the drawbridge, Rassendyll goes inside alone. Though outnumbered, he manages to kill Michael in a sword fight. Then Sapt and von Tarlenheim come to his aid. When Rupert is cornered by the three men, he chooses death over a waterfall rather than execution for treason.
In the aftermath, Rudolf resumes his rightful position, while Rassendyll hides out at the lodge. By chance, Flavia stops there to speak with Colonel Sapt. Despite Sapt's attempt to shield the princess from heartbreak, a servant girl blurts out that the ""king"" is staying at the lodge. Rassendyll is forced to tell his beloved the bitter truth. When he tries to persuade her to leave with him, her sense of honour and duty to her country compel her to stay, and Rassendyll departs alone.",englishman rudolf rassendyl lewi stone decid pass time attend coron distant relat king rudolf v ruritania also play stone encount acquaint train antoinett de mauban barbara la marr mistress king treacher brother grand duke black michael stuart holm day coron rassendyl seen colonel sapt robert edeson captain fritz von tarlenheim malcolm mcgregor astound uncanni resembl rassendyl lieg take meet rudolf hunt lodg king delight doubl invit dinner meal servant bring fine bottl wine present michael deliv henchman rupert hentzau ramon novarro rudolf tast find irresist drink entir bottl next morn sapt unabl rous wine drug sapt afraid coron postpon michael seiz throne countri danger divid support rudolf michael colonel declar fate brought rassendyl ruritania take rudolf place one wiser englishman less certain toss coin land rudolf favor rassendyl goe ceremoni afterward driven palac compani univers ador princess flavia alic terri later rassendyl return lodg switch place king sapt find corps josef snitz edward servant left guard king rassendyl forc continu masquerad rudolf guard hand trust retain zenda castl michael tri unsuccess bribe rassendyl leav day follow rasssendyl becom acquaint flavia two fall love meanwhil rupert tri alien antoinett michael tell michael marri flavia rudolf way howev unintend effect antionett reveal michael plan rudolf locat von tarlenheim dwarf assassin john georg michael pay tri garrot rassendyl sapt interrupt finish job wouldb killer mistakenli signal anxious wait michael deed done duke hasten zenda quietli dispos real king howev rassendyl render unconsci von tarlenheim arriv news three men chase michael sapt von tarlenheim split find way castl antoinett lower drawbridg rassendyl goe insid alon though outnumb manag kill michael sword fight sapt von tarlenheim come aid rupert corner three men choos death waterfal rather execut treason aftermath rudolf resum right posit rassendyl hide lodg chanc flavia stop speak colonel sapt despit sapt attempt shield princess heartbreak servant girl blurt king stay lodg rassendyl forc tell belov bitter truth tri persuad leav sens honour duti countri compel stay rassendyl depart alon

However, Molly tells her father (Edward Jobson) that she cannot marry someone who is not one of her ""own people"", however much she loves him. Instead, she agrees to marry longtime suitor Horace Bennett (Robert Ober), who had been a good friend of Slade's. Bennett tells Amos to stay away from his future wife, but when he also calls Amos a murderer, Amos chokes him into apologizing. As he leaves, Amos is struck in the head by a rock thrown by Bennett. Seeing this, Molly rushes to Amos's side and breaks off her engagement to Bennett.
The happy couple decide on an early wedding, but Amos has a vision showing him being murdered the day before. He has had visions before; all came true, even if he tried to prevent them. His family is supposedly descended from Prince Arjuna; the god Krishna granted Arjuna and all his descendants the gift of prophesy. When he reveals this to his future father-in-law (who has already witnessed the accuracy of Amos's visions), the latter suggests he lock himself away in the sanatorium of a friend for the day.
Amos does so, but Amhad Beg and his men find and kidnap him. Just as they are about to kill him, Amos is rescued by the mystic Narada (Josef Swickard), who also can see into the future, and his followers. Narada convinces him to forgo his own happiness and return to India to overthrow the tyrant. When Amos is welcomed by his people and the army revolts, Ali Khan commits suicide. The new Maharajah of Dharmagar takes comfort in his latest vision, which shows his wedding to Molly.",fifteen year joshua judd charl ogl tell adopt son amo valentino real father indian maharajah overthrown ali khan bertram grassbi amo young boy play uncredit pat moor rescu gener devi da gadi georg periolat taken america safeti joshua merchant brother trust friend late maharajah amo attend harvard univers incur hatr austin slade jr jack gid beat spot row team parti celebr row victori archriv yale jealou slade call amo yellow pour drink caus amo punch slade grab chair weapon amo duck slade fall open window death amo clear wrongdo newspap stori attract notic amhad beg j farrel macdonald ali khan prime minist summer parti host close friend stephen van kovert william boyd amo becom attract one guest molli cabot wanda hawley chanc molli famili decid vacat amoss hometown becom better acquaint amo overcom molli initi dislik howev molli tell father edward jobson marri someon one peopl howev much love instead agre marri longtim suitor horac bennett robert ober good friend slade bennett tell amo stay away futur wife also call amo murder amo choke apolog leav amo struck head rock thrown bennett see molli rush amoss side break engag bennett happi coupl decid earli wed amo vision show murder day vision came true even tri prevent famili supposedli descend princ arjuna god krishna grant arjuna descend gift prophesi reveal futur fatherinlaw alreadi wit accuraci amoss vision latter suggest lock away sanatorium friend day amo amhad beg men find kidnap kill amo rescu mystic narada josef swickard also see futur follow narada convinc forgo happi return india overthrow tyrant amo welcom peopl armi revolt ali khan commit suicid new maharajah dharmagar take comfort latest vision show wed molli

1923,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,American,Wallace Worsley,"Lon Chaney, Patsy Ruth Miller, Norman Kerry",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_(1923_film),"The story is set in Paris in 1482. Quasimodo is a deaf, half-blind, hunchbacked bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. His master Jehan, the evil brother of Notre Dame's saintly archdeacon Don Claudio, prevails upon the hunchback to kidnap the fair Esmeralda, a dancing gypsy girl (and the adopted daughter of Clopin, the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris' underworld). The dashing Captain Phoebus rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees (later in the film, Quasimodo begins to hate Jehan because of this). At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square before Esmeralda and Don Claudio come to his aid.
To their dismay, Jehan and Clopin learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by King Louis XI. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt. Clopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet Pierre Gringoire to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Before Phoebus arrives, he is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Don Claudio grant her sanctuary.
Later that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus's dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force. Quasimodo holds off the invaders with rocks and torrents of molten lead. Meanwhile, the healed Phoebus is alerted by Gringoire and leads his men against the rabble. When Quasimodo finds Jehan attacking Esmeralda, he throws his former master off the ramparts of Notre Dame, but not before being fatally stabbed in the back. Phoebus finds and embraces Esmeralda. Witnessing this, Quasimodo rings his own death toll, and Gringoire and Don Claudio enter the bell tower just in time to see him die. The last image is of the great bell swinging silently above the hunchback's corpse.",stori set pari 1482 quasimodo deaf halfblind hunchback bellring famou cathedr notr dame pari master jehan evil brother notr dame saintli archdeacon claudio prevail upon hunchback kidnap fair esmeralda danc gypsi girl adopt daughter clopin king oppress beggar pari underworld dash captain phoebu rescu esmeralda quasimodo jehan abandon flee later film quasimodo begin hate jehan first seek casual romanc phoebu becom entranc esmeralda take wing quasimodo sentenc lash public squar esmeralda claudio come aid dismay jehan clopin learn phoebu hope marri esmeralda despit engag fleur de ly phoebu persuad esmeralda accompani ball celebr appoint captain guard king loui xi provid rich garment introduc hostess madam de gondelauri princess egypt clopin accompani beggar crash festiv demand esmeralda return avoid bloodsh esmeralda say belong aristocraci later howev esmeralda send street poet pierr gringoir give phoebu note arrang rendezv notr dame say goodby phoebu arriv stab back jehan esmeralda fals sentenc death crime rescu gallow quasimodo carri insid cathedr claudio grant sanctuari later night clopin lead whole underworld storm cathedr jehan attempt take esmeralda first guil tell phoebuss die wish take care forc quasimodo hold invad rock torrent molten lead meanwhil heal phoebu alert gringoir lead men rabbl quasimodo find jehan attack esmeralda throw former master rampart notr dame fatal stab back phoebu find embrac esmeralda wit quasimodo ring death toll gringoir claudio enter bell tower time see die last imag great bell swing silent hunchback corps

1923,Our Hospitality,American,"John G. Blystone, Buster Keaton",Buster Keaton,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Hospitality,"The Canfield and McKay families have been feuding for so long, no one remembers the reason the feud started in the first place. One stormy night in 1810, family patriarch John McKay (Edward Coxen) and his rival James Canfield (Tom London) kill each other. After the tragic death of her husband, John's wife decides her son Willie (the infant Buster Keaton Jr.) will not suffer the same fate. She moves to New York to live with her sister, who after the mother's death raises him without telling him of the feud.
Twenty years later, Willie (Buster Keaton Sr.) receives a letter informing him that his father's estate is now his. His aunt tells him of the feud, but he decides to return to his Southern birthplace anyway to claim his inheritance. On the train ride, he meets a girl, Virginia (played by Keaton's wife Natalie Talmadge). They are shy to each other at first, but become acquainted during many train mishaps. At their destination, she is greeted by her father (Joe Roberts) and two brothers (Ralph Bushman and Craig Ward); she, it turns out, is a Canfield. Willie innocently asks one of the brothers where the McKay estate is. The brother offers to show him the way, but stops at every shop in search of a pistol to shoot the unsuspecting Willie. By the time he obtains one, Willie has wandered off. Willie is very disappointed to discover the McKay ""estate"" is a rundown home, not the stately mansion he had imagined. Later, however, he encounters Virginia, who invites him to supper.
When he arrives, the brothers want to shoot him, but the father refuses to allow it while he is a guest in their mansion. The father refers to this as ""our hospitality"". When Willie overhears a conversation between the brothers, he finally realizes his grave predicament. A parson comes to supper as well. Afterward, the parson prepares to leave, but he finds it is raining furiously. The Canfield patriarch insists the parson stay the night. McKay invites himself to do the same.
The next morning, McKay stays inside the house, while the Canfield men wait for his departure. The father catches McKay kissing his daughter. McKay finally manages to leave safely by putting on a woman's dress. However, a chase ensues. He eventually starts down a steep cliff side, but is unable to find a way to the bottom. One Canfield lowers a rope (so he can get a better shot) to which Willie ties himself, but the Canfield falls into the water far below, dragging Willie along. Finally, Willie manages to steal the train locomotive and tender, but the tender derails, dumping him into the river towards the rapids. Virginia spots him and goes after him in a rowboat; she falls into the water and is swept over the edge of the large waterfall. McKay swings trapeze-like on a rope, catching her hands in mid-fall and depositing her safely on a ledge.
When it grows dark, the Canfield men decide to continue their murderous search the next day. Returning home, they see Willie and Virginia embracing; Joseph Canfield furiously rushes into the room, gun in hand. He is brought up short by the parson, who asks him if he wishes to kiss the bride. Seeing a hanging ""love thy neighbor"" sampler, the father decides to bless the union and end the feud.

1923,The Pilgrim,American,Charles Chaplin,"Charles Chaplin, Edna Purviance",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pilgrim_(1923_film),"The Pilgrim (Chaplin), an escaped convict, steals a minister's clothes to replace his prison uniform. At a train station, he encounters an eloping couple who want him to marry them. The woman's father shows up and takes her away.
The convict then picks a destination at random and ends up in Devil's Gulch, Texas, on a Sunday. A delegation is waiting to welcome their new parson. With the sheriff nearby, the Pilgrim has to keep playing his part. A large deacon takes him to the church, where he improvises a sermon about David and Goliath.
It has been arranged for the parson to board with Mrs. Brown and her attractive daughter. The latter and the Pilgrim are attracted to each other. A complication arises when the crook, the Pilgrim's old cellmate, spots him. Curious, the man pretends to be the Pilgrim's old college friend and is invited to tea by Mrs. Brown. Among the other guests are a man and wife and their young boy, who proceeds to annoy everyone. Also present is the large deacon, who refuses to accept Mrs. Brown's mortgage payment on the Sabbath. Despite the Pilgrim's best efforts, the crook later steals the money and flees. The Pilgrim promises Miss Brown he will get the money back. After he leaves, however, the sheriff shows the young woman a wanted poster for her boarder.
The crook heads to a casino. Despite a robbery in progress, the Pilgrim manages to retrieve the money. He gives it and the church collection to Miss Brown. When he is apprehended by the sheriff, Miss Brown comes to his defense, revealing what he has done. As a result, the sheriff takes his prisoner to the border and orders him to pick him some flowers on Mexican land. Not taking the hint, the Pilgrim returns. The sheriff has to literally kick him out of American jurisdiction before he recognizes the lawman's act of kindness. However, his enjoyment of the peace of a new land proves to be short-lived; several gunmen pop out of the undergrowth and start shooting at each other.

1923,Safety Last!,American,"Fred C. Newmeyer, Sam Taylor",Harold Lloyd,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_Last!,"The film opens in 1922 with Harold Lloyd (the character has the same name as the actor) behind bars. His mother and his girlfriend, Mildred, are consoling him as a somber official and priest show up. The three of them walk toward what looks like a noose. It then becomes obvious they are at a train station and the ""noose"" is actually a trackside pickup hoop used by train crews to receive orders without stopping, and the bars are merely the ticket barrier. He promises to send for his girlfriend so they can get married once he has ""made good"" in the big city. Then he is off.
He gets a job as a salesclerk at the De Vore Department Store, where he has to pull various stunts to get out of trouble with the picky and arrogantly self-important head floorwalker, Mr. Stubbs. He shares a rented room with his pal ""Limpy"" Bill, a construction worker.
When Harold finishes his shift, he sees an old friend from his hometown who is now a policeman walking the beat. After he leaves, Bill shows up. Bragging to Bill about his supposed influence with the police department, he persuades Bill to knock the policeman backwards over him while the man is using a callbox. When Bill does so, he knocks over the wrong policeman. To escape, he climbs up the façade of a building. The policeman tries to follow, but cannot get past the first floor; in frustration, he shouts at Bill, ""You'll do time for this! The first time I lay eyes on you again, I'll pinch you!""
Meanwhile, Harold has been hiding his lack of success by sending his girlfriend expensive presents he cannot really afford. She mistakenly thinks he is successful enough to support a family and, with his mother's encouragement, takes a train to join him. In his embarrassment, he has to pretend to be the general manager, even succeeding in impersonating him to get back at Stubbs. While going to retrieve her purse (which Mildred left in the manager's office), he overhears the real general manager say he would give $1,000 to anyone who could attract people to the store. He remembers Bill's talent and pitches the idea of having a man climb the ""12-story Bolton building"", which De Vore's occupies. He gets Bill to agree to do it by offering him $500. The stunt is highly publicized and a large crowd gathers the next day.
When a drunkard shows ""The Law"" (the policeman who was pushed over) a newspaper story about the event, the lawman suspects Bill is going to be the climber. He waits at the starting point despite Harold's frantic efforts to get him to leave. Finally, unable to wait any longer, Bill suggests Harold climb the first story himself and then switch his hat and coat with Bill, who will continue on from there.

1923,Scaramouche,American,Rex Ingram,"Ramón Novarro, Alice Terry, Lewis Stone",adventure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaramouche_(1923_film),"André-Louis Moreau (Ramon Novarro) loves Aline de Kercadiou (Alice Terry), the niece of his godfather, Quintin de Kercadiou (Lloyd Ingraham), and she him. However Quintin would prefer she married the Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr (Lewis Stone), a middle-aged nobleman, rather than someone who does not even know who his parents are.
One day, expert swordsman de la Tour first toys with, then kills André's friend Philippe de Vilmorin in a duel. André turns to the King's Lieutenant for justice. However, when the official learns who the accused is, he immediately orders André's arrest. André flees.
Meanwhile, France nears the brink of revolution. When one orator in favor of liberty and equality is shot down by a soldier, André fearlessly takes his place and remains undaunted when he is grazed by a bullet. When the dragoons are called out to disperse the mob, an admirer named Chapelier helps André escape.
He joins a wandering theatre troupe led by Challefau Binet (James A. Marcus). André writes better plays for them to perform, and they become very successful, eventually performing at a theatre in Paris. André becomes engaged to Binet's daughter, Climène (Edith Allen).
Aline and de la Tour attend a performance of his latest work, however, and she and André spot each other. She goes to see him, but he does not wish to renew their relationship. De la Tour, despite loving Aline, cannot help trifling with Climène. By chance, Aline and Countess de Plougastel (Julia Swayne Gordon), with whom she is staying, see him in a carriage with Climène. Aline informs de la Tour she never wants to see him again. De la Tour blackmails the countess into helping him, reminding her of an incident in her past.
Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, the aristocrats, unable to effectively respond to the reform-minded delegates with words, resort to duels to eliminate their leading opponents. Chief among the duelists is de la Tour. In desperation, Danton and Chapelier recruit André to reply in kind. The Chevalier de Chabrillone (William Humphrey) is his first victim. Eventually, he gets what he wants: a duel with de la Tour. He disarms his foe, then allows him to pick up his sword. After André wounds the nobleman in his sword arm, de la Tour gives up.
When news reaches Paris that the Austrians and Prussians have invaded France in support of the beleaguered King Louis XVI, the French Revolution erupts. In the fighting, de la Tour is overwhelmed and left for dead. When he revives, he staggers to the residence of the countess. André heads there too, to rescue his love and his mother the countess (whose identity has been revealed to him by de Kercadiou), armed with a passport signed by Danton authorizing him to do anything he wants. When the two bitter enemies spot each other, de la Tour demands the passport. André refuses, whereupon de la Tour draws a pistol. The countess throws herself in front of de la Tour, then reveals that he is in fact André's father. The two men have an initially uneasy reconciliation. When de la Tour starts to leave, André offers him his sword. Thus armed, de la Tour faces the rioters in the street and perishes.
André places the two women in a covered carriage. At the Paris gate, a man spots the aristocrats inside and demands they be handed over to the mob. Moreau pleads with them to let them go for his sake. The masses respond with extravagant sentimentality, and the trio are allowed to leave Paris.",andréloui moreau ramon novarro love alin de kercadi alic terri niec godfath quintin de kercadi lloyd ingraham howev quintin would prefer marri marqui de la tour dazyr lewi stone middleag nobleman rather someon even know parent one day expert swordsman de la tour first toy kill andré friend philipp de vilmorin duel andré turn king lieuten justic howev offici learn accus immedi order andré arrest andré flee meanwhil franc near brink revolut one orat favor liberti equal shot soldier andré fearlessli take place remain undaunt graze bullet dragoon call dispers mob admir name chapeli help andré escap join wander theatr troup led challefau binet jame marcu andré write better play perform becom success eventu perform theatr pari andré becom engag binet daughter climèn edith allen alin de la tour attend perform latest work howev andré spot goe see wish renew relationship de la tour despit love alin help trifl climèn chanc alin countess de plougastel julia swayn gordon stay see carriag climèn alin inform de la tour never want see de la tour blackmail countess help remind incid past meanwhil nation assembl aristocrat unabl effect respond reformmind deleg word resort duel elimin lead oppon chief among duelist de la tour desper danton chapeli recruit andré repli kind chevali de chabrillon william humphrey first victim eventu get want duel de la tour disarm foe allow pick sword andré wound nobleman sword arm de la tour give news reach pari austrian prussian invad franc support beleagu king loui xvi french revolut erupt fight de la tour overwhelm left dead reviv stagger resid countess andré head rescu love mother countess whose ident reveal de kercadi arm passport sign danton author anyth want two bitter enemi spot de la tour demand passport andré refus whereupon de la tour draw pistol countess throw front de la tour reveal fact andré father two men initi uneasi reconcili de la tour start leav andré offer sword thu arm de la tour face rioter street perish andré place two women cover carriag pari gate man spot aristocrat insid demand hand mob moreau plead let go sake mass respond extravag sentiment trio allow leav pari
1923,The Shock,American,Lambert Hillyer,"Lon Chaney, Virginia Valli",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_(1923_film),"In 1906, Wilse Dilling (Lon Chaney), a crippled gangster living like a brute in the savage streets of Chinatown, receives a coded message to go to the home of his boss, Ann Cardington (Christine Mayo), known as Queen Anne, a powerful crime boss feared in the underworld. When Wilse meets with her, she sends him to the town of Fallbrook, where he is to await her instructions in dealing with a former lover of hers, a banker named Micha Hadley (William Welsh), who had betrayed her. Dilling is to pose as a telegraph operator in his effort to watch the banker.
Being practically dependent on crutches and wheelchair-bound has not stopped Dilling from committing a lengthy series of crimes, but to his surprise, he finds that the small town atmosphere makes him feel differently about everything. He finds a good friend in Hadley's daughter Gertrude (Virginia Valli), whom Dilling not only falls in love with her but she helps him believe that he can make a fresh start. Gertrude, however, is engaged to Jack Cooper (Jack Mower).
Dilling's new-found contentment is soon shattered by a series of new developments which includes trying to stop Queen Ann's plot against Hadley and Gertrude. Threatened with exposure as a thief, Hadley lashes out at Dilling when he confesses his part in the scheme. When an attempt to blow up the bank goes badly, Gertrude and Cooper are caught in the blast. With Gertrude severely injured, Cooper's father forces him to break off their engagement.
With the bank records destroyed, bank examiners are unable to find evidence against Hadley. After surgery, his daughter is expected to make a complete recovery but Queen Anne still seeks his revenge. Dilling tries to recover a document that his boss is holding, but with her henchmen, she captures Gerturde to Dilling's despair. Before anything can happen, everyone in the Manadarin Cafe, the gangsters' headquarters, as well as the entire city, is caught up in the San Francisco earthquake. Dilling survives and later in recuperation, is able to recover the use of his legs, beginning a new life with Gertrude.",1906 wils dill lon chaney crippl gangster live like brute savag street chinatown receiv code messag go home boss ann cardington christin mayo known queen ann power crime boss fear underworld wils meet send town fallbrook await instruct deal former lover banker name micha hadley william welsh betray dill pose telegraph oper effort watch banker practic depend crutch wheelchairbound stop dill commit lengthi seri crime surpris find small town atmospher make feel differ everyth find good friend hadley daughter gertrud virginia valli dill fall love help believ make fresh start gertrud howev engag jack cooper jack mower dill newfound content soon shatter seri new develop includ tri stop queen ann plot hadley gertrud threaten exposur thief hadley lash dill confess part scheme attempt blow bank goe badli gertrud cooper caught blast gertrud sever injur cooper father forc break engag bank record destroy bank examin unabl find evid hadley surgeri daughter expect make complet recoveri queen ann still seek reveng dill tri recov document boss hold henchmen captur gerturd dill despair anyth happen everyon manadarin cafe gangster headquart well entir citi caught san francisco earthquak dill surviv later recuper abl recov use leg begin new life gertrud

1923,Souls for Sale,American,Rupert Hughes,"Richard Dix, Eleanor Boardman",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_for_Sale,"Remember ""Mem"" Steddon (Eleanor Boardman) marries Owen Scudder (Lew Cody) after a whirlwind courtship. However, on their wedding night, she has a change of heart. When the train taking them to Los Angeles stops for water, she impulsively and secretly gets off in the middle of the desert. Strangely, when Scudder realizes she is gone, he does not have the train stopped.
Mem sets off in search of civilization. Severely dehydrated, she sees an unusual sight: an Arab on a camel. It turns out to be actor Tom Holby (Frank Mayo); she has stumbled upon a film being shot on location. When she recuperates, she is given a role as an extra. Both Holby and director Frank Claymore (Richard Dix) are attracted to her. However, when filming ends, she does not follow the troupe back to Hollywood, but rather gets a job at a desert inn.
Meanwhile, Scudder is recognized and arrested at the train station. He turns out to be a cold-blooded murderer who marries women, insures them, and then kills them for the payoff. He escapes and persuades a gullible Abigail Tweedy (Dale Fuller) to file off his handcuffs. She becomes his next victim, though fortunately for her, he only robs her of her savings. He leaves the country and targets Englishwoman Lady Jane (Aileen Pringle). To his profound embarrassment, she turns out to be the same sort of crook as he; she and her father ""Lord Fryingham"" (William Orlamond) rob him, but let him live.
When the inn closes for the season, Mem travels to Hollywood in search of work. Her actress friend from the desert shoot, Leva Lemaire (Barbara La Marr), persuades Claymore to give her a screen test for the only uncast role in his next production: a comic part. Though she fails miserably, Claymore decides to train her anyway. She proves to be talented and steadily gets better and better parts.
Just as Mem is rising to fame, Scudder returns and sneaks into her bedroom. Holby and Claymore have become rivals for Mem's affections. When Scudder sees their warmly autographed photographs, he flies into a jealous rage. Mem, aware of her husband's past and fearful of a career-ending scandal, offers him money to leave her alone, but he wants her. Scudder leaves only when she threatens to kill herself. Claymore shows up, but when Scudder overhears the director propose marriage to his protegée, Scudder tries to shoot him. Claymore wrestles away his gun, but lets him go at Mem's urging.
When star Robina Teele (Mae Busch) is seriously injured by a falling light, Claymore decides to have Mem take her place. Filming continues on an outdoor circus set, complete with a full-scale Big Top tent. In the climax, a lightning storm sets the huge tent on fire in the middle of filming. (Claymore orders his cameramen to keep shooting.) Scudder, who has snuck into the audience of extras, takes advantage of the panic and confusion to try to kill an unsuspecting Claymore by driving a wind machine (with a deadly propeller) at him. Holby spots Scudder and struggles with him. When Mem stumbles into the machine's path, Scudder rushes to save her and loses his own life. He apologizes before dying, explaining that all his life there was something wrong with him, but he did at least one thing right. Afterward, Mem chooses Claymore over Holby.",rememb mem steddon eleanor boardman marri owen scudder lew codi whirlwind courtship howev wed night chang heart train take lo angel stop water impuls secretli get middl desert strang scudder realiz gone train stop mem set search civil sever dehydr see unusu sight arab camel turn actor tom holbi frank mayo stumbl upon film shot locat recuper given role extra holbi director frank claymor richard dix attract howev film end follow troup back hollywood rather get job desert inn meanwhil scudder recogn arrest train station turn coldblood murder marri women insur kill payoff escap persuad gullibl abigail tweedi dale fuller file handcuff becom next victim though fortun rob save leav countri target englishwoman ladi jane aileen pringl profound embarrass turn sort crook father lord fryingham william orlamond rob let live inn close season mem travel hollywood search work actress friend desert shoot leva lemair barbara la marr persuad claymor give screen test uncast role next product comic part though fail miser claymor decid train anyway prove talent steadili get better better part mem rise fame scudder return sneak bedroom holbi claymor becom rival mem affect scudder see warmli autograph photograph fli jealou rage mem awar husband past fear careerend scandal offer money leav alon want scudder leav threaten kill claymor show scudder overhear director propos marriag protegé scudder tri shoot claymor wrestl away gun let go mem urg star robina teel mae busch serious injur fall light claymor decid mem take place film continu outdoor circu set complet fullscal big top tent climax lightn storm set huge tent fire middl film claymor order cameramen keep shoot scudder snuck audienc extra take advantag panic confus tri kill unsuspect claymor drive wind machin deadli propel holbi spot scudder struggl mem stumbl machin path scudder rush save lose life apolog die explain life someth wrong least one thing right afterward mem choos claymor holbi
1923,The Ten Commandments,American,Cecil B. DeMille,Theodore Roberts,epic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ten_Commandments_(1923_film),"Despite its epic scale, the Moses story takes up only about the first third of the film. After that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. Two brothers make opposite decisions, one, John, to follow his mother's teaching of the Ten Commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, Danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. The film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous.
A thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. The mother reads the story of Moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of God. The carpenter, however, reads from the New Testament story of Jesus's healing of lepers. His emphasis is on a loving and forgiving God. The film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version.
Danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. In her dying breath, she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love.
This sends Danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. To make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. He attempts to flee to Mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed.
Throughout the film, the visual motif of the tablets of the commandments appears in the sets, with a particular commandment appearing on them when it is relevant to the story.",despit epic scale mose stori take first third film stori chang modern set involv live lesson command two brother make opposit decis one john follow mother teach ten command becom poor carpent danni break everi one rise top film show uncheck immor momentarili gain ultim disastr thought contrast made carpent brother mother mother read stori mose emphas strict obedi fear god carpent howev read new testament stori jesuss heal leper emphasi love forgiv god film also show mother strict law moral flaw comparison son version danni becom corrupt contractor build church shoddi concret pocket money save becom rich one day mother come visit work site wall becom unstabl due shake heavi truck nearbi road one wall collaps top mother kill die breath tell danni fault teach fear god taught love send danni downward spiral attempt right wrong clear conscienc get troubl make money steal pearl mistress fight back kill attempt flee mexico motorboat rough weather send cours crash rocki island presum kill throughout film visual motif tablet command appear set particular command appear relev stori
1923,Three Ages,American,Buster Keaton,Buster Keaton,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Ages,"Three plots in three different historical periods—prehistoric times, Ancient Rome, and modern times (the Roaring Twenties)—are intercut to prove the point that man's love for woman has not significantly changed throughout history. In all three plots, characters played by the small and slight Buster Keaton and handsome bruiser Wallace Beery compete for the attention of the same woman, played by Margaret Leahy. Each plot follows similar ""arcs"" in the story line in which Keaton's character works for his beloved's attention and eventually wins her over.
In the Stone Age story line, Keaton competes with the bigger, brutish Beery for a cavewoman Leahy. After observing another caveman drag away a woman by the hair in order to ""claim"" her, Keaton tries to become more assertive, but is continuously pushed back and bullied by Beery. An attempt to make Leahy jealous by flirting with another woman ends in failure. Nevertheless, Keaton grows closer to Leahy, and Beery challenges him to a fight at sunrise. Keaton wins thanks to hiding a rock in his club, but is caught and tied to the tail of an elephant to be dragged around the dirt as punishment. Upon his return, he finds Leahy about to be claimed by Beery and attempts to make off with her. Beery catches him and the two battle by tossing boulders at each other from afar, with Keaton and Leahy on a cliff together. When Beery climbs up to reclaim Leahy, Keaton dispatches Leahy's cronies and finally defeats him. He drags a smitten Leahy off by the hair. In the epilogue, they go off for a walk with their huge family of children following them.
In the Ancient Rome segment, Keaton attempts to attract the attention of the wealthy Leahy, but is continually pushed back by Beery. Beery challenges him to a chariot race after a hard snow — Keaton wins by using sled dogs instead of horses. In revenge, Beery forces him into the lion pit belonging to Leahy's family. Keaton survives by befriending the lion and cleaning its claws. Keaton is rescued by Leahy's parents while Beery kidnaps Leahy. Keaton rescues her and tries to seduce her in her palanquin, which takes off without them. In the epilogue, they also go out for a walk with many children in tow.
In the ""modern times"" story line, Keaton is a poor man yearning for Leahy, who has rich parents. Leahy's mother, unimpressed with Keaton's bank account but interested in Beery's, decides on Beery as a match for her daughter. Keaton accidentally gets drunk at a restaurant where Beery and Leahy are dining, and Beery tricks the male half of another couple into punching Keaton, who stumbles home drunk. Later, Keaton impresses Leahy by playing a football game, whereas Beery is only a coach; Beery decides to play opposite Keaton. Keaton is overwhelmed by the bigger Beery, but ends up winning the game with an impressive touchdown. An irritated Beery frames Keaton for possession of alcohol and gets him arrested, simultaneously showing him a wedding announcement between him and Leahy — Keaton will be unable to stop the wedding while in jail. While shadowed by a guard, Keaton finds a criminal file showing that Beery has been charged with bigamy and forgery. He attempts to call Leahy to warn her. He accidentally escapes when the phone booth he's using is taken out for replacement. Keaton evades the police chasing him and make it to the church on time, dragging Leahy away from the wedding and into a cab. After showing her Beery's criminal file, he takes Leahy home and prepares to leave, but she kisses him. He declares to the cab driver that they're going back to the church. In the epilogue, they also go out for a walk — this time with their dog instead of children.",three plot three differ histor periods—prehistor time ancient rome modern time roar twenties—ar intercut prove point man love woman significantli chang throughout histori three plot charact play small slight buster keaton handsom bruiser wallac beeri compet attent woman play margaret leahi plot follow similar arc stori line keaton charact work belov attent eventu win stone age stori line keaton compet bigger brutish beeri cavewoman leahi observ anoth caveman drag away woman hair order claim keaton tri becom assert continu push back bulli beeri attempt make leahi jealou flirt anoth woman end failur nevertheless keaton grow closer leahi beeri challeng fight sunris keaton win thank hide rock club caught tie tail eleph drag around dirt punish upon return find leahi claim beeri attempt make beeri catch two battl toss boulder afar keaton leahi cliff togeth beeri climb reclaim leahi keaton dispatch leahi croni final defeat drag smitten leahi hair epilogu go walk huge famili children follow ancient rome segment keaton attempt attract attent wealthi leahi continu push back beeri beeri challeng chariot race hard snow — keaton win use sled dog instead hors reveng beeri forc lion pit belong leahi famili keaton surviv befriend lion clean claw keaton rescu leahi parent beeri kidnap leahi keaton rescu tri seduc palanquin take without epilogu also go walk mani children tow modern time stori line keaton poor man yearn leahi rich parent leahi mother unimpress keaton bank account interest beeri decid beeri match daughter keaton accident get drunk restaur beeri leahi dine beeri trick male half anoth coupl punch keaton stumbl home drunk later keaton impress leahi play footbal game wherea beeri coach beeri decid play opposit keaton keaton overwhelm bigger beeri end win game impress touchdown irrit beeri frame keaton possess alcohol get arrest simultan show wed announc leahi — keaton unabl stop wed jail shadow guard keaton find crimin file show beeri charg bigami forgeri attempt call leahi warn accident escap phone booth he use taken replac keaton evad polic chase make church time drag leahi away wed cab show beeri crimin file take leahi home prepar leav kiss declar cab driver theyr go back church epilogu also go walk — time dog instead children
1923,The White Sister,American,Henry King,"Lillian Gish, Ronald Colman",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Sister_(1923_film),"Angela Chiaromonte (Lillian Gish) and Captain Giovanni Severini (Ronald Colman) are deeply in love, but Angela's wealthy father, Prince Chiaromonte, does not know this and arranges her marriage, without her knowledge, to the son of Count del Ferice. However, the prince dies in an accident.
While Angela grieves, her older half-sister, the Marchesa di Mola, looks through their late father's papers and secretly burns one of them. No will can be found, so not only does the entire estate go to the Marchesa, but because the prince's second marriage was not registered with the civil authorities, it is not legally valid, making Angela ""nobody"". With that, Count del Ferice dissolves the marriage contract between Angela and his son.
The Marchesa orders Angela to leave the palace that very day, revealing that she has always hated her stepsister for ""whining"" her way into their father's affection and for taking Giovanni, the only man she ever loved. Madame Bernard, Angela's companion and chaperone, takes her in.
Giovanni finds her, but has some bad news. He has been appointed to command an expedition to Africa and must leave the next morning. However, he promises they will be married the day he returns.
His camp is attacked by Arabs, and Italian newspapers announce that all have been massacred. When Angela hears the news, she becomes catatonic. She is taken to the Santa Giovanna d'Aza hospital, which is run by nuns. After several days, the painter Durand, himself hopelessly in love with Angela, paints a portrait of Giovanni and brings it to the hospital, hoping it will help. Angela at first mistakes it for Giovanni, kissing it several times, but then comes to her senses. After a while, she informs Monsignor Seracinesca, an old family friend, that she intends to become a nun, a white sister, in honor of Giovanni.
However, Giovanni is still alive. For two years, he languishes as a captive until the death of his sole comrade gives him the chance to overpower their guard and escape. On the ship back to Italy, he is ordered not to speak to anyone until he has seen the Minister of War. That same day, Angela takes her final vows in a solemn ceremony, dedicating her life to the Catholic Church.
Giovanni's older brother, Professor Ugo Severi, breaks down after years of research trying to harness the power of Mount Vesuvius and is taken to the Santa Giovanna d'Aza hospital. Giovanni visits him, and by chance, meets Angela. After their initial shock, he embraces and tries to kiss her. She responds at first, but then remembers her circumstances and runs to her room. Monsignor Saracinesca restrains Giovanni from following, explaining that Angela is now married to the Church.
Giovanni refuses to accept that. He lures Angela by false pretenses to his brother's observatory. He tries to get her to sign a petition to the Pope requesting a release from her vows, but she refuses. When Giovanni sees that all his pleadings are useless, he allows her to leave.
The Marchesa tries to persuade Monsignor Saracinesca that Angela has gone willingly to be with her lover. He does not believe her, but sets out for the observatory anyway. Meanwhile, Giovanni notices that his brother's invention indicates that Vesuvius is about to erupt. He rides to warn the townsfolk, passing Saracinesca on the way.
The Marchesa's carriage is wrecked when her horses bolt, startled by lightning. Fatally injured, she crawls and stumbles to an empty church, her only thought to confess her sins before dying. By chance, Angela seeks shelter there. Not recognizing her, the Marchesa confesses she burned the will out of hatred and asks if her sister will forgive her. After a visible struggle with her emotions, Angela says she does, before her sister passes away.

1923,A Woman of Paris,American,Charles Chaplin,Edna Purviance,romance drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Woman_of_Paris,"Marie St. Clair and her beau, aspiring artist Jean Millet, plan to leave their small French village for Paris, where they will marry. On the night before their scheduled departure, Marie leaves her house for a rendezvous with Jean. Marie's stepfather locks her out of the house, telling her to find shelter elsewhere.
Jean invites Marie to his parents' home, but his father also refuses to let her stay. Jean escorts Marie to the train station, and promises to return after going home to pack. When he arrives at home, he discovers his father has died. When Jean telephones Marie at the station to tell her they must postpone their trip, she gets on the train without him.
One year later in Paris, Marie enjoys a life of luxury as the mistress of wealthy businessman Pierre Revel. A friend calls and invites Marie to a raucous party in the Latin Quarter. She gives Marie the address but can't remember whether the apartment is in the building on the right or the left. Marie enters the wrong building and is surprised to be greeted by Jean Millet, who shares a modest apartment with his mother. Marie tells Jean she would like for him to paint her portrait and gives him a card with her address.
Jean calls on Marie at her apartment to begin the painting. Marie notices he is wearing a black armband and asks why he is in mourning. Jean tells Marie his father died the night she left without him.
Marie and Jean revive their romance, and Marie distances herself from Pierre Revel. Jean finishes Marie's portrait, but instead of painting her wearing the elegant outfit she chose for the sitting, he paints her in the simple dress she wore on the night she left for Paris.
Jean proposes to Marie. Jean's mother fights with him over the proposal. Marie arrives unexpectedly outside Jean's apartment just in time to overhear Jean pacify his mother, telling her that he proposed in a moment of weakness. Jean fails to convince Marie he didn't mean what she overheard, and she returns to Pierre Revel.
The following night, Jean slips a gun into his coat pocket and goes to the exclusive restaurant where Marie and Pierre are dining. Jean and Pierre get into a scuffle, and Jean is ejected from the dining room. Jean fatally shoots himself in the foyer of the restaurant.
The police carry Jean's body to his apartment. Jean's mother retrieves the gun and goes to Marie's apartment, but Marie has gone to Jean's studio. Jean's mother returns and finds Marie sobbing by Jean's body. The two women reconcile and return to the French countryside, where they open a home for orphans in a country cottage.
One morning, Marie and one of the girls in her care walk down the lane to get a pail of milk. Marie and the girl meet a group of sharecroppers who offer them a ride back in their horse-drawn wagon. At the same time, Pierre Revel and another gentleman are riding through the French countryside in a chauffeur-driven automobile. Pierre's companion asks him, ""What ever happened to that Marie St. Clair?"" Pierre replies that he doesn't know.

1924,America,American,D. W. Griffith,"Carol Dempster, Neil Hamilton",historical,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_(1924_film),"The story shifts between the British in Northern New York, and the colonial patriots in Massachusetts and Virginia. Much later in the film in New York, a little remembered sub-plot takes place.[4] British general Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), a loyal and ruthless supporter to the king, leads the Iroquois Native Americans in viciously barraging attacks against the settlers, including the massacre of women and children, who are siding with the Revolution.
In Lexington, Massachusetts, Nathan Holden (Neil Hamilton) works as an express rider and minute man for the Boston Committee of Public Safety. At a mission to deliver a dispatch to the Virginia legislature, he meets Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster) and falls in love with her, but her father Justice Montague (Erville Alderson), a Tory judge, is not impressed with the rider.[6] Captain Butler tries unsuccessfully to court Nancy. Nathan and Nancy declare that regardless of which side he fights for, they will always love each other. While visiting in Massachusetts, Justice Montague is accidentally shot by Nathan Holden. Nancy Montague’s brother, Charles Montague (Charles Emmett Mack), is influenced by George Washington’s heroism and decides that he wants to support the colonists. However, he dies shortly after being wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Nancy hides the truth from her father when she tells him that her brother died fighting for the crown.
Nancy and her father travel to Mohawk Valley New York to the home of her Uncle Ashleigh Montague while Holden visits George Washington (Arthur Dewey) at Valley Forge. He gets sent to New York with Morgan’s raiders to settle down the Native American attacks up north. Butler occupies the Montague estate. His men kill Montague's brother and he arrests Montague and takes Nancy prisoner. Holden arrives to spy on Butler and overhears his plans for a massacre attack. He leaves to sound the alarm, reluctantly leaving Nancy behind with Butler. Butler plans to force himself on Nancy, but the Native Americans decide to attack immediately and Butler is compelled to join them. Nancy escapes when Butler leaves for the battle, and she and Montague reach the fort safely before the attack. The attackers mount ruthless attack on the fort, ultimately breaching the walls and killing many settlers.[4] The Morgan’s raiders arrive and liberate the fort, saving the lives of Montague and Nancy. A separate group of militia and Native Americans chase down and kill Butler, putting a stop to his plan.[6] Montague believes in Holden’s worth, and allows him and Nancy to be together. The film concludes with the surrender of General Cornwallis and the presidential inauguration of George Washington.",stori shift british northern new york coloni patriot massachusett virginia much later film new york littl rememb subplot take place4 british gener captain walter butler lionel barrymor loyal ruthless support king lead iroquoi nativ american vicious barrag attack settler includ massacr women children side revolut lexington massachusett nathan holden neil hamilton work express rider minut man boston committe public safeti mission deliv dispatch virginia legislatur meet nanci montagu carol dempster fall love father justic montagu ervil alderson tori judg impress rider6 captain butler tri unsuccess court nanci nathan nanci declar regardless side fight alway love visit massachusett justic montagu accident shot nathan holden nanci montagu ’ brother charl montagu charl emmett mack influenc georg washington ’ heroism decid want support colonist howev die shortli wound battl bunker hill nanci hide truth father tell brother die fight crown nanci father travel mohawk valley new york home uncl ashleigh montagu holden visit georg washington arthur dewey valley forg get sent new york morgan ’ raider settl nativ american attack north butler occupi montagu estat men kill montagu brother arrest montagu take nanci prison holden arriv spi butler overhear plan massacr attack leav sound alarm reluctantli leav nanci behind butler butler plan forc nanci nativ american decid attack immedi butler compel join nanci escap butler leav battl montagu reach fort safe attack attack mount ruthless attack fort ultim breach wall kill mani settlers4 morgan ’ raider arriv liber fort save live montagu nanci separ group militia nativ american chase kill butler put stop plan6 montagu believ holden ’ worth allow nanci togeth film conclud surrend gener cornwal presidenti inaugur georg washington

1924,Beau Brummel,American,Harry Beaumont,"John Barrymore, Mary Astor",historical,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Brummel_(1924_film),"In 1795, the cream of English aristocracy attend the wedding of ""tradesman's daughter"" Margery. She loves Beau Brummel, a penniless captain in the Tenth Hussars, but has been pressured into agreeing to marry Lord Alvanley, exchanging her family's wealth for social standing and a title. When Brummel comes to see her just before the wedding, she begs him to take her away, but her ambitious mother, Mrs. Wertham, intervenes, and Margery gives way. Embittered, Brummel decides to seek revenge against society using his ""charm, wit and personal appearance"".
At a dinner given by the Prince of Wales for the officers of his regiment, the Prince is attracted to Mrs. Snodgrass, the innkeeper's wife. When Brummel rescues him from the irate husband, he takes a great liking to the captain, enabling Brummel to attach himself to His Royal Highness.
By 1811, Brummel has made his house in London the ""rendezvous of the smart world"" and himself the arbiter of fashion. When Lord Henry Stanhope catches him dallying with his infatuated wife, a duel ensues. Lord Henry misses, whereupon Brummel fires his pistol into the air. Afterward, however, Brummel informs Lady Hester Stanhope that he never loved her. She attracts the attention of the womanizing Prince.
She and another enemy he has made set out to turn the Prince against him. Brummel unwittingly helps them, having become too sure of his position; he is rude to his royal friend. Brummel turns his attentions to the Duchess of York, the Prince's sister-in-law. She agrees to a late night private supper, but Lady Margery shows up first. She warns him that his enemies are hard at work; one knows about the rendezvous. The Prince arrives unannounced, expecting to find the Duchess, but is (pleasantly) surprised to find Lady Margery instead. When she rejects his initial advances, he offers to appoint Brummel the Ambassador to France. Lady Margery is delighted at the prospect, but it is all for naught. Shortly afterward, the two men quarrel openly, and neither is interested in a reconciliation.
No longer able to fend off his creditors as a result of the withdrawal of the Prince's favor, Brummel flees to Calais to avoid going to debtors prison, accompanied only by his loyal butler Mortimer. Years pass, and the Prince, now King George IV, stops at Calais. In his entourage is Lady Margery. Both see Brummel standing by the side of the road. Without his master's knowledge, Mortimer goes to see the King, pretending to represent Brummel in an effort to heal the breach. When Brummel finds out, he discharges Mortimer. Lady Margery comes to see Brummel in his garret. Her husband has died, and she asks him to marry her. He turns her down, saying he is too worn out and tired, perhaps even of love. After she departs, his resolution wavers, but he regains control of himself.
In old age, Brummel ends up in the hospital prison of Bon Saveur. The ever-faithful Mortimer visits him, but Brummel's mind has deteriorated - he does not recognize his old servant at first. Mortimer informs him that the King has died and that Lady Margery is very ill. The scene shifts to the latter's bed. Her spirit leaves her body and travels to Brummel's cell. When Brummel also dies, their youthful souls are joyfully reunited.",1795 cream english aristocraci attend wed tradesman daughter margeri love beau brummel penniless captain tenth hussar pressur agre marri lord alvanley exchang famili wealth social stand titl brummel come see wed beg take away ambiti mother mr wertham interven margeri give way embitt brummel decid seek reveng societi use charm wit person appear dinner given princ wale offic regiment princ attract mr snodgrass innkeep wife brummel rescu irat husband take great like captain enabl brummel attach royal high 1811 brummel made hous london rendezv smart world arbit fashion lord henri stanhop catch dalli infatu wife duel ensu lord henri miss whereupon brummel fire pistol air afterward howev brummel inform ladi hester stanhop never love attract attent woman princ anoth enemi made set turn princ brummel unwittingli help becom sure posit rude royal friend brummel turn attent duchess york princ sisterinlaw agre late night privat supper ladi margeri show first warn enemi hard work one know rendezv princ arriv unannounc expect find duchess pleasantli surpris find ladi margeri instead reject initi advanc offer appoint brummel ambassador franc ladi margeri delight prospect naught shortli afterward two men quarrel openli neither interest reconcili longer abl fend creditor result withdraw princ favor brummel flee calai avoid go debtor prison accompani loyal butler mortim year pass princ king georg iv stop calai entourag ladi margeri see brummel stand side road without master knowledg mortim goe see king pretend repres brummel effort heal breach brummel find discharg mortim ladi margeri come see brummel garret husband die ask marri turn say worn tire perhap even love depart resolut waver regain control old age brummel end hospit prison bon saveur everfaith mortim visit brummel mind deterior recogn old servant first mortim inform king die ladi margeri ill scene shift latter bed spirit leav bodi travel brummel cell brummel also die youth soul joy reunit

Judkins, who is the lighthouse keeper, rescued January from a shipwreck when she was an infant. The only clue to the baby's identity was a locket with a photograph of a woman around her neck, so Judkins adopted her as his own daughter.
January helps Judkins with his tasks around the lighthouse. As Judkins' heart begins to fail and his health worsens, these tasks become increasingly more complicated and important. In one instance, January must ascend to the top of the lighthouse by herself to light the lamps. The local townsfolk become skeptical of Judkins' ability to care for the girl, and try to have her taken away.
January is saved from the orphanage by a chance meeting with Isabelle Morton (Irene Rich), an affluent young woman who comes to visit the lighthouse. She believes that January looks familiar; when she sees the photograph in the locket, she identifies January as her late sister's child.
Isabelle wishes to adopt January and reunite her with her blood relatives. Faced with his poor health and the scrutiny of the townspeople, Judkins agrees. However, the girl is miserable in her new surroundings, runs away, and finds her way back to the lighthouse. Judkins and the Morton family finally devise a means to make everyone happy: January returns to the Mortons, and Judkins is employed on the family's yacht, ensuring that he will always be able to visit his former daughter.",captain januari babi peggi young girl live lighthous main guardian jeremiah daddi judkin hobart bosworth judkin lighthous keeper rescu januari shipwreck infant clue babi ident locket photograph woman around neck judkin adopt daughter januari help judkin task around lighthous judkin heart begin fail health worsen task becom increasingli complic import one instanc januari must ascend top lighthous light lamp local townsfolk becom skeptic judkin abil care girl tri taken away januari save orphanag chanc meet isabel morton iren rich affluent young woman come visit lighthous believ januari look familiar see photograph locket identifi januari late sister child isabel wish adopt januari reunit blood rel face poor health scrutini townspeopl judkin agre howev girl miser new surround run away find way back lighthous judkin morton famili final devis mean make everyon happi januari return morton judkin employ famili yacht ensur alway abl visit former daughter

1924,Girl Shy,American,"Fred Newmeyer, Sam Taylor","Harold Lloyd, Jobyna Ralston",romantic comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Shy,"Harold Meadows (Lloyd) is a tailor's apprentice for his uncle in Little Bend, California. He is so shy around women that he can barely speak to them (to stop his stuttering, his uncle has to blow a whistle). Despite this, Harold writes a ""how to"" book for young men entitled The Secret of Making Love, detailing how to woo different types of young women, such as ""the vampire"" and ""the flapper"" (in scenes that parodied two other popular films of the time, Trifling Women and Flaming Youth[citation needed]), and takes a train to see a publisher in Los Angeles.
The same day, rich young Mary Buckingham (Ralston) boards the same train after her automobile breaks down in Little Bend. No dogs are allowed aboard, so she hides her Pomeranian under her shawl, but her pet jumps off as the train pulls away. Harold rescues her dog and helps Mary hide it from the conductor. She sees his manuscript, so he starts telling her about his book, overcoming his stuttering in his enthusiasm. They become so absorbed in each other that neither realizes that the train has reached its final destination and everyone else has departed. Upon returning home, Mary rejects the latest in a string of marriage proposals from persistent suitor Ronald DeVore, a self-centered rich man who is almost twice Mary's age and who harbors no true feelings for her, but merely wants her as a trophy wife.
After her car is repaired, Mary intentionally detours through Little Bend repeatedly, hoping to see Harold again. On one such trip, Ronald is also along for the ride, and his unwanted attentions cause Mary to swerve and get her car stuck near the outskirts of Little Bend. While Ronald walks back to town for a tow, Mary goes for a walk and happens to reunite with Harold. After telling Mary about the remainder of his book, Harold informs her that he is going to see the publisher, Roger Thornby, in a few days to deliver a new chapter that will be about her. They agree to meet again afterward. Meanwhile, Ronald runs into a middle-aged woman who asks if he is finally going to introduce her to his family, but he stalls, then rides away in the tow-vehicle.
Mr. Thornby's professional readers find Harold's book hilariously absurd, so he rejects it. Without any royalty money, Harold figures he cannot ask Mary to marry him. So he pretends that he was only using her as part of his research. Heartbroken, Mary impulsively agrees to marry Ronald. Afterward, though, one of Mr. Thornby's senior employees convinces him that, if the staff liked the book so much, there must be a market for it, so Thornby decides to publish it as ""The Boob's Diary"".
A few days later, a depressed Harold gets a letter from the publisher, but just rips it up without opening it, assuming that it is a rejection notice. Fortunately, his uncle notices that one of the scraps is part of an advance royalty check for $3,000; the accompanying letter states that the book will be published as a comedy. At first, Harold is outraged, but then he realizes that he can propose to Mary after all. However, when he sees a newspaper headline announcing Mary and Ronald's wedding that same day at her family's estate, he gives up. By chance, the same woman whom Ronald had met a few days earlier walks in and, seeing the newspaper story, tearfully exclaims that she is Ronald's wife. As proof, she shows Harold a locket with the couple's wedding portrait and the engraved words ""to my wife"" that Ronald had given her two years earlier.
Harold embarks on a frenzied headlong dash, involving bootleggers, car chases and multiple changes of vehicle (from missing the train to various cars to a trolley to a police motorcycle to a horse-drawn wagon to horseback), through the countryside and along the crowded streets of Culver City and Los Angeles.

1924,Greed,American,Erich von Stroheim,"ZaSu Pitts, Gibson Gowland",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed_(film),"John McTeague is a miner working in Placer County, California. A traveling dentist calling himself Dr. ""Painless"" Potter visits the town, and McTeague's mother begs Potter to take her son on as an apprentice. Potter agrees and McTeague eventually becomes a dentist, practicing on Polk Street in San Francisco.
Marcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, his cousin and intended fiancée, into McTeague's office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine her. As they wait for an opening, Trina buys a lottery ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court Trina. After seeing McTeague's conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000.[a] Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between McTeague and Schouler. After McTeague and Trina wed, they continue to live in their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.
Schouler leaves the city to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for practicing dentistry without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 in addition to the original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).
Trina's bitten fingers become infected and have to be amputated. To earn money she becomes a janitor at a children's school. She withdraws the $5,000 from the bank to keep it close to her, eventually spreading it on her bed so she can sleep on it. McTeague then returns, having spent the money he took, and asks Trina for more. The following day McTeague confronts Trina at the school. After a heated argument McTeague beats Trina to death and steals her $5,000.
Now an outlaw, McTeague returns to Placer County and teams up with a prospector named Cribbens. Headed towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of quartz and plan to become millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.
The oppressive heat slows McTeague's progress. Schouler's progress is also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague and moves in to arrest him. After a confrontation, McTeague's horse bolts and Schouler shoots it, puncturing the water container. The water spills onto the desert floor. The pair fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor; however, Schouler has handcuffed himself to McTeague. The film ends with McTeague left in the desert with no horse and no water, handcuffed to a corpse and unable to reach the remaining money.
Von Stroheim's original edit contained two main sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted the lives of the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and after having lost his mind, leaps into San Francisco Bay.
The second sub-plot depicts the lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly boarders who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall and listen to the other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.",john mcteagu miner work placer counti california travel dentist call dr painless potter visit town mcteagu mother beg potter take son apprentic potter agre mcteagu eventu becom dentist practic polk street san francisco marcu schouler bring trina siepp cousin intend fiancé mcteagu offic dental work schouler mcteagu friend mcteagu gladli agre examin wait open trina buy lotteri ticket mcteagu becom enamor trina beg schouler permiss court trina see mcteagu convict schouler agre trina eventu agre marri mcteagu shortli afterward lotteri ticket win 5000a schouler bitterli claim money caus rift mcteagu schouler mcteagu trina wed continu live small apart trina refus spend 5000 schouler leav citi becom cattl rancher goe secretli order ruin former friend report mcteagu practic dentistri without licens mcteagu order shut practic face jail even though save 200 addit origin 5000 lotteri ticket trina unwil spend money money becom increasingli scarc coupl forc sell possess mcteagu final snap bite trina finger fit rage later goe fish earn money take trina save total 450 trina bitten finger becom infect amput earn money becom janitor children school withdraw 5000 bank keep close eventu spread bed sleep mcteagu return spent money took ask trina follow day mcteagu confront trina school heat argument mcteagu beat trina death steal 5000 outlaw mcteagu return placer counti team prospector name cribben head toward death valley find larg quantiti quartz plan becom millionair begin mine mcteagu sens danger flee death valley singl hors remain money one water jug sever marshal pursu join schouler schouler want catch mcteagu person ride death valley alon oppress heat slow mcteagu progress schouler progress also begin wane spi mcteagu move arrest confront mcteagu hors bolt schouler shoot punctur water contain water spill onto desert floor pair fight one last time mcteagu prove victor howev schouler handcuf mcteagu film end mcteagu left desert hors water handcuf corps unabl reach remain money von stroheim origin edit contain two main subplot later cut point subplot contrast two possibl outcom trina mcteagu life togeth first depict live junkman zerkow maria miranda macapa young mexican woman collect junk zerkow sold trina lotteri ticket maria often talk imaginari solid gold dine set zerkow becom obsess eventu believ rich hidden away zerkow marri often ask give differ answer time mention zerkow believ becom obsess pri truth murder lost mind leap san francisco bay second subplot depict live charl w granni miss anastasia baker granni baker two elderli boarder share adjoin room apart complex trina mcteagu live throughout time apart complex met sit close adjoin wall listen compani know almost everyth final meet hide longtim feel reveal love granni admit 5000 make rich trina make littl differ eventu marri door connect room
1924,He Who Gets Slapped,American,Victor Sjöström,"Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, John Gilbert",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Who_Gets_Slapped,"Paul Beaumont (Lon Chaney) is a scientist who labored for years alone to prove his radical theories on the origin of mankind. Baron Regnard (Marc McDermott) becomes his patron, enabling him to do research while living in his mansion. One day, Beaumont announces to his beloved wife Marie and the Baron that he has proved all his theories and is ready to present them before the Academy of the Sciences. He leaves the arrangements to the Baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the safe containing his papers, and gives them to the baron.
On the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with the Baron. He is aghast when the Baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit for Paul's work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in front of everyone, but the Baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the baron are having an affair and calls him a clown. Paul leaves them.
Five years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling himself ""HE who gets slapped"", the star attraction of a small circus near Paris. His act consists of his getting slapped every evening by other clowns, and includes Paul pretending to present in front of the Academy of Science.
Another of the performers is Bezano (John Gilbert), a daredevil horseback rider. Consuelo (Norma Shearer), the daughter of the impoverished Count Mancini, applies to join his act. Bezano falls in love with Consuelo, as does Paul. Consuelo and her father, however, are planning to restore the family's fortunes with a marriage to her father's wealthy friend.
One night, during HE's performance, he spots the baron in the audience. The baron goes backstage and begins flirting with Consuelo, which she does not like. The next day, the baron sends Consuelo jewelry, but she rejects it.
When her father leaves for a meeting with the baron, Bezano takes Consuelo out to the countryside for a romantic meeting, where they declare their love for each other. Meanwhile, Count Mancini convinces the reluctant baron that the only way he can have Consuelo is by marrying her. The baron discards the heartbroken Marie, leaving her with a check.
Later, HE admits to Consuelo he, too, is in love with her. She thinks he is kidding and laughingly slaps him. They are interrupted by the baron and the count, who inform Consuelo she will marry the baron after the night's performance. When HE tries to interfere, he is locked in an adjoining room, where an angry lion is kept in a cage. He moves the cage so that, when he carefully opens it, only the door to the next room prevents the lion from escaping. HE re-enters the other room through the only other entrance (making sure to lock it behind him) and reveals his identity to the baron. HE threatens the baron, but the count stabs him with a sword.
The baron and the count try to leave but, finding the main entrance locked, open the side door, releasing the lion. The animal kills the count, then the baron. However, the lion tamer shows up and saves HE from the same fate. HE goes on stage and collapses. He assures Consuelo he is happy and that she will be happy, before dying in her arms.",paul beaumont lon chaney scientist labor year alon prove radic theori origin mankind baron regnard marc mcdermott becom patron enabl research live mansion one day beaumont announc belov wife mari baron prove theori readi present academi scienc leav arrang baron howev beaumont goe sleep mari steal key open safe contain paper give baron appoint day paul travel academi baron aghast baron instead introduc take credit paul work recov shock paul confront front everyon baron tell paul mere assist slap academician laugh humili paul later seek comfort wife brazenli admit baron affair call clown paul leav five year pass paul clown call get slap star attract small circu near pari act consist get slap everi even clown includ paul pretend present front academi scienc anoth perform bezano john gilbert daredevil horseback rider consuelo norma shearer daughter impoverish count mancini appli join act bezano fall love consuelo paul consuelo father howev plan restor famili fortun marriag father wealthi friend one night he perform spot baron audienc baron goe backstag begin flirt consuelo like next day baron send consuelo jewelri reject father leav meet baron bezano take consuelo countrysid romant meet declar love meanwhil count mancini convinc reluct baron way consuelo marri baron discard heartbroken mari leav check later admit consuelo love think kid laughingli slap interrupt baron count inform consuelo marri baron night perform tri interfer lock adjoin room angri lion kept cage move cage care open door next room prevent lion escap reenter room entranc make sure lock behind reveal ident baron threaten baron count stab sword baron count tri leav find main entranc lock open side door releas lion anim kill count baron howev lion tamer show save fate goe stage collaps assur consuelo happi happi die arm
1924,Helen's Babies,American,William A. Seiter,"Baby Peggy, Edward Everett Horton, Clara Bow",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen%27s_Babies_(film),"Toodie and Budge are identified as the two best children in the world. They enjoy a comfortable life with their parents Tom and Helen Lawrence. Helen's brother is Harry Burton, a wealthy bachelor who, although never having had one, is an expert on knowing how to raise children. When Tom and Helen receive a letter from Harry, in which he announces he will travel to them for a vacation, they see an opportunity to get a break from the kids. Knowing that Harry is an expert on children, they assume that he will appreciate the gesture and leave just after he arrives. Unbeknownst to them, Harry only wrote a book about raising children because his publisher told him to, and actually he isn't fond of children at all. He reluctantly takes the position as the babysitter of his nieces and is escorted by Alice Mayton, the Lawrence's attractive neighbor.
It soon becomes clear that Harry won't get any rest, as the careless girls often annoy him by getting themselves into danger or going through his possessions. Many of the dangerous situations Toodie gets herself into include climbing a tree and attempting to shave herself. Although they always try to help him out, Toodie and Budge only make things worse. Harry is only irritated by their constant attempts to comfort him and isn't able to take advantage of his own advice on raising children. He writes Helen a letter, in which he threatens to abandon the girls if she doesn't return immediately. However, before he is able to send it he is interrupted by a visit from Alice. Alice has always been a big admirer of his work, but notices that he isn't a real expert on parenting. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, she invites him over for dinner.
Harry, secretly having a crush on Alice, accepts the invitation and shreds the letter into pieces. He wants to win over her affection at dinner and buys some fancy flowers. Unbeknownst to him, Toodie had secretly replaced the flowers with her doll. As he hands Alice the box, she is surprised to receive the doll, but thinks of it as a comic gesture. While Harry and Alice grow closer, the children run away to follow a dog they notice. Harry and Alice immediately start to look for them and they cross a group of Spanish gypsies. Noticing a piece of clothing on the ground belonging to one of the girls, Harry suspects that they have kidnapped the girls and violently starts to look for them.
Meanwhile, the girls are playing with the dog on the railroad tracks and are almost hit by a train. Coincidentally, Tom and Helen are traveling on that train to surprise the girls with an early return. They are devastated that their daughters almost died and think that Harry is fully responsible. They start yelling at Harry, until they find out how fond the daughters are of him. The film ends with Harry and Alice kissing each other.",toodi budg identifi two best children world enjoy comfort life parent tom helen lawrenc helen brother harri burton wealthi bachelor although never one expert know rais children tom helen receiv letter harri announc travel vacat see opportun get break kid know harri expert children assum appreci gestur leav arriv unbeknownst harri wrote book rais children publish told actual isnt fond children reluctantli take posit babysitt niec escort alic mayton lawrenc attract neighbor soon becom clear harri wont get rest careless girl often annoy get danger go possess mani danger situat toodi get includ climb tree attempt shave although alway tri help toodi budg make thing wors harri irrit constant attempt comfort isnt abl take advantag advic rais children write helen letter threaten abandon girl doesnt return immedi howev abl send interrupt visit alic alic alway big admir work notic isnt real expert parent give benefit doubt invit dinner harri secretli crush alic accept invit shred letter piec want win affect dinner buy fanci flower unbeknownst toodi secretli replac flower doll hand alic box surpris receiv doll think comic gestur harri alic grow closer children run away follow dog notic harri alic immedi start look cross group spanish gypsi notic piec cloth ground belong one girl harri suspect kidnap girl violent start look meanwhil girl play dog railroad track almost hit train coincident tom helen travel train surpris girl earli return devast daughter almost die think harri fulli respons start yell harri find fond daughter film end harri alic kiss

Adams brings his daughter Dorothy to England to see a specialist about her heart trouble. So that she will not be hounded by the press and fortune hunters, Dorothy makes herself up to look extremely plain. Impoverished Lord Paul Menford spies her without the hideous disguise and falls in love with her immediately. When he is mistaken for his uncle, the heart specialist Adams seeks, he goes along in order to meet her. Meanwhile, his agent sells the Menford family estate to Adams. When Menford finally admits the ruse, Dorothy sends him away.
Later that night, he gets drunk and goes home, only he has forgotten that he no longer lives at the Menford estate. He crawls into his old room, only to find Dorothy there. Frightened, she makes him leave and barricades the door for good measure. However, he just reenters the room through another door. When she faints, he picks her up and carries her into another bedroom. The butler, his old former servant, sees him do this.
The next morning, Dorothy comes down for breakfast, and is annoyed to find the butler has put out two table settings. When one of Paul's friends shows up unexpectedly and finds them dining together, Paul introduces Dorothy as his wife to avoid a scandal. The butler overhears, and soon the joyous ""news"" has spread to the village. Dorothy's father arrives. When the villagers gather outside to loudly wish the newlyweds well, Mr. Adams believes that his daughter has married as well. Paul eventually tries to clear things up, but Adams thinks he is just joking. Adams is finally convinced when he finds Paul preparing to sleep in a different bedroom from his ""wife"".
Having gotten over her initial dislike for Paul, she agrees to his suggestion that they get married for real. However, when she overhears Joe Diamond congratulating Paul for landing a wealthy heiress and demanding 10% as promised, the wedding is off. Paul sadly leaves.
Dorothy's father sees that she is heartbroken without Paul. Paul returns, having received a letter from her, apologizing for her behaviour and asking him to come see her before he leaves for Paris. She is puzzled (but secretly overjoyed), as she did not write it. While Paul packs some of his belongings, she goes to consult her father, who confesses that he is responsible. She begs him to do something to keep Paul from leaving. He has Paul's car sent away and creates a fake rainstorm using a hose. Paul is taken in at first, but then sees that it is only raining on one side of the house.

At first, they have great difficulty looking after themselves (as they had servants to do that for them), but adapt after a few weeks. At one point, they sight a navy ship and hoist a brightly colored flag, not realizing it signals that the ship is under quarantine. As a result, the other vessel turns away.
Finally, the ship grounds itself near an inhabited tropical island and springs a leak. While Rollo dons a deep sea diving suit and submerges to patch the hole, the natives canoe out and take Betsy captive. When Rollo emerges from the ocean, the natives are scared off, enabling him to rescue Betsy and take her back to the ship. The natives return and try to board the ship. After a fierce struggle, Rollo and Betsy try to escape in a small dinghy. It starts to sink, and the natives swiftly overtake them in their canoes. Just when all seems lost, a navy submarine surfaces right underneath them and they are saved.",wealthi rollo treadway buster keaton suddenli decid propos neighbor across street betsi obrien kathryn mcguir send servant book passag honeymoon sea cruis honolulu betsi reject sudden offer howev decid go trip anyway board without delay night pier number partial cover end wrong ship navig betsi rich father frederick vroom sold small countri war agent small nation conflict decid set ship adrift night betsi father check ship captur tie ashor saboteur betsi hear cri help board ship look cut loos navig drift pacif ocean two unwit passeng eventu find first great difficulti look servant adapt week one point sight navi ship hoist brightli color flag realiz signal ship quarantin result vessel turn away final ship ground near inhabit tropic island spring leak rollo don deep sea dive suit submerg patch hole nativ cano take betsi captiv rollo emerg ocean nativ scare enabl rescu betsi take back ship nativ return tri board ship fierc struggl rollo betsi tri escap small dinghi start sink nativ swiftli overtak cano seem lost navi submarin surfac right underneath save

1924,"Sherlock, Jr.",American,Buster Keaton,"Buster Keaton, Kathryn McGuire",comedy,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock,_Jr.","A movie theater projectionist and janitor (Buster Keaton) is in love with a beautiful girl (Kathryn McGuire). However, he has a rival, the ""local sheik"" (Ward Crane). Neither has much money. The projectionist buys a $1 box of chocolates, all he can afford, and changes the price to $4 before giving it and a ring to her. The sheik steals and pawns the girl's father's pocket watch for $4. With the money, he buys a $3 box of chocolates for the girl. When the father notices his watch is missing, the sheik slips the pawn ticket into the projectionist's pocket unnoticed. The projectionist, studying to be a detective, offers to solve the crime, but when the pawn ticket is found in his pocket, he is banished from the girl's home.
While showing a film about the theft of a pearl necklace, the projectionist falls asleep and dreams that he enters the movie as a detective, Sherlock Jr. The other actors are replaced by the projectionist's ""real"" acquaintances. The dream begins with the theft being committed by the villain (played by the local sheik) with the aid of the butler (played by the hired man). The girl's father calls for the world's greatest detective, and Sherlock Jr. arrives. Fearing that they will be caught, the villain and the butler attempt to kill Sherlock through several traps, poison, and an elaborate pool game with an exploding 13 ball. When these fail, the villain and butler try to escape. Sherlock Jr. tracks them down to a warehouse but is outnumbered by the gang that the villain was selling the necklace to. During the confrontation, Sherlock discovers that they have kidnapped the girl. With the help of his assistant, Gillette, Sherlock Jr. manages to escape this situation, save the girl, and defeat the gang.
When he awakens, the girl shows up to tell him that she and her father learned the identity of the real thief after she went to the pawn shop to see who actually pawned the pocket watch.

1924,The Thief of Bagdad,American,Raoul Walsh,"Douglas Fairbanks, Snitz Edwards, Charles Belcher, Julanne Johnston, Anna May Wong",swashbuckler,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thief_of_Bagdad_(1924_film),"Ahmed robs as he pleases in the city of Baghdad. Wandering into a mosque, he tells the holy man he disdains his religion; his philosophy is, ""What I want, I take.""
That night, he sneaks into the palace of the caliph using a magic rope he stole during ritual prayers. All thoughts of plunder are forgotten when he sees the sleeping princess, the caliph's daughter. The princess's Mongol slave discovers him and alerts the guards, but he gets away.
When his associate Abu reminds the disconsolate Ahmed that a bygone thief once stole another princess during the reign of Haroun al-Rashid, Ahmed sets out to do the same. The next day is the princess's birthday. Three princes arrive, seeking her hand in marriage (and the future inheritance of the city). Another of the princess's slaves foretells that she will marry he who first touches a rose-tree in her garden. The princess watches anxiously as first the glowering Prince of the Indies, then the obese Prince of Persia (an uncredited Mathilde Comont), and finally the Prince of the Mongols pass by the rose-tree. The mere sight of the Mongol fills the princess with fear, but when Ahmed appears (disguised in stolen garments as a suitor), she is delighted. The Mongol slave tells her countryman of the prophecy, but before he can touch the rose-tree, Ahmed's startled horse tosses its rider into it.
That night, following ancient custom, the princess chooses Ahmed for her husband. Out of love, Ahmed gives up his plan to abduct her and confesses all to her in private. The Mongol prince learns from his spy, the princess's Mongol slave, that Ahmed is a common thief and informs the caliph. Ahmed is lashed mercilessly, and the caliph orders he be torn apart by a giant ape, but the princess has the guards bribed to let him go.
When the caliph insists she select another husband, her loyal slave advises her to delay. She asks that the princes each bring her a gift after ""seven moons""; she will marry the one who brings her the rarest. In despair, Ahmed turns to the holy man. He tells the thief to become a prince, revealing to him the peril-fraught path to a great treasure.
The Prince of the Indies obtains a magic crystal ball from the eye of a giant idol, which shows whatever he wants to see, while the Persian prince buys a flying carpet. The Mongol prince leaves behind his henchman, telling him to organize the soldiers he will send to Bagdad disguised as porters. (The potentate has sought all along to take the city; the beautiful princess is only an added incentive.) After he lays his hands on a magic apple which has the power to cure anything, even death, he sends word to the Mongol slave to poison the princess. After many adventures, Ahmed gains a cloak of invisibility and a small chest of magic powder which turns into whatever he wishes when he sprinkles it. He races back to the city.
The three princes meet as agreed at a caravansary before returning to Bagdad. The Mongol asks the Indian to check whether the princess has waited for them. They discover that she is near death, and ride the flying carpet to reach her. Then the Mongol uses the apple to cure her. The suitors argue over which gift is rarest, but the princess points out that without any one gift, the remaining two would have been useless in saving her life. Her loyal slave shows her Ahmed in the crystal ball, so the princess convinces her father to deliberate carefully on his future son-in-law. The Mongol prince chooses not to wait, unleashing his secret army that night and capturing Bagdad.
Ahmed arrives at the city gate, shut and manned by Mongols. When he conjures up a large army with his powder, the Mongol soldiers flee. The Mongol prince is about to have one of his men kill him when the Mongol slave suggests he escape with the princess on the flying carpet. Ahmed liberates the city and rescues the princess, using his cloak of invisibility to get through the Mongols guarding their prince. In gratitude, the caliph gives his daughter to him in marriage.",ahm rob pleas citi baghdad wander mosqu tell holi man disdain religion philosophi want take night sneak palac caliph use magic rope stole ritual prayer thought plunder forgotten see sleep princess caliph daughter princesss mongol slave discov alert guard get away associ abu remind disconsol ahm bygon thief stole anoth princess reign haroun alrashid ahm set next day princesss birthday three princ arriv seek hand marriag futur inherit citi anoth princesss slave foretel marri first touch rosetre garden princess watch anxious first glower princ indi obes princ persia uncredit mathild comont final princ mongol pass rosetre mere sight mongol fill princess fear ahm appear disguis stolen garment suitor delight mongol slave tell countryman propheci touch rosetre ahm startl hors toss rider night follow ancient custom princess choos ahm husband love ahm give plan abduct confess privat mongol princ learn spi princesss mongol slave ahm common thief inform caliph ahm lash mercilessli caliph order torn apart giant ape princess guard bribe let go caliph insist select anoth husband loyal slave advis delay ask princ bring gift seven moon marri one bring rarest despair ahm turn holi man tell thief becom princ reveal perilfraught path great treasur princ indi obtain magic crystal ball eye giant idol show whatev want see persian princ buy fli carpet mongol princ leav behind henchman tell organ soldier send bagdad disguis porter potent sought along take citi beauti princess ad incent lay hand magic appl power cure anyth even death send word mongol slave poison princess mani adventur ahm gain cloak invis small chest magic powder turn whatev wish sprinkl race back citi three princ meet agre caravansari return bagdad mongol ask indian check whether princess wait discov near death ride fli carpet reach mongol use appl cure suitor argu gift rarest princess point without one gift remain two would useless save life loyal slave show ahm crystal ball princess convinc father deliber care futur soninlaw mongol princ choos wait unleash secret armi night captur bagdad ahm arriv citi gate shut man mongol conjur larg armi powder mongol soldier flee mongol princ one men kill mongol slave suggest escap princess fli carpet ahm liber citi rescu princess use cloak invis get mongol guard princ gratitud caliph give daughter marriag

1924,Wild Oranges,American,King Vidor,"Virginia Valli, Frank Mayo",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Oranges,"John Woolfolk and his wife are riding down a country lane in a horse-drawn wagon. They have an accident, and while John survives unharmed, his wife is killed. Disillusioned, he adopts a reclusive life on the sea, sailing along the Atlantic coast in his schooner Yankee, accompanied only by his ship's mate, Paul Halvard.
One afternoon, the men steer the Yankee across a bar into an inlet along the Georgia coast. The inlet is inhabited by Litchfield Stope (the master of the once-grand house that sits on the inlet, who developed a lifelong distrust of strangers during the American Civil War) his granddaughter Millie, and Nicholas, a ""homicidal maniac"" (according to a murder charge) who had bullied his way into Stope's household. Nicholas wants to marry Millie and threatens to place her in an swamp full of alligators if she refuses to kiss him.
After anchoring the Yankee, John takes a rowboat ashore. He briefly meets Millie and she gives him a few wild oranges before he goes back to his boat.
Nicholas proves hostile to John and Paul when they go on the island to get some fresh water, as he doesn't want them to fall in love with Millie.
The next day, when John and Paul are on the Yankee's deck, Millie comes to the shore and asks to be invited to come aboard. Once aboard, they begin a brief voyage. During the trip, Millie says she envies John's freedom, but he corrects her, invoking his dead wife. When they go back to the island, they are greeted by Nicholas who is carrying a concealed knife. Nicholas and John have short fight, ending with an unharmed John and an angry Nicholas.
That night Nicholas confronts Millie and asks her to marry him. When Millie says she is not interested, he threatens her.
Meanwhile, John, still fearful of becoming attached to someone, instructs Paul to get the ship under way immediately. Two days later, he has a change of heart and steers the Yankee back into the inlet. He meets Millie again and they say that they love with each other. After explaining that she is afraid of Nicholas, John convinces her to go to the wharf with her grandfather at eight o'clock that night.
That evening, Nicholas sees Millie and Litchfield attempting to escape. He kills Litchfield and ties up Millie in a bed upstairs with a gag over her mouth.
At nine o'clock, worried by the fact that nobody came to the wharf, John goes to the house to investigate. As he accidentally makes some noise, Nicholas finds him and they fight each other. Meanwhile, Millie had managed to free herself after a long struggle. She and John (who survived the fight unharmed) head to the wharf and make it safely aboard. Paul warns that it is low tide and that the boat would just barely clear the bar, but John convinces him to raise the sails anyway.
Nicholas, using a gun John dropped during the fight, begins shooting at the boat, wounding Paul. A vicious dog that Litchfield had kept chained up breaks free and kills Nicholas.
Millie manages to safely steer the boat past the bar. In the final scene, the next day, John and Millie kiss each other as a healing Paul watches.",john woolfolk wife ride countri lane horsedrawn wagon accid john surviv unharm wife kill disillus adopt reclus life sea sail along atlant coast schooner yanke accompani ship mate paul halvard one afternoon men steer yanke across bar inlet along georgia coast inlet inhabit litchfield stope master oncegrand hous sit inlet develop lifelong distrust stranger american civil war granddaught milli nichola homicid maniac accord murder charg bulli way stope household nichola want marri milli threaten place swamp full allig refus kiss anchor yanke john take rowboat ashor briefli meet milli give wild orang goe back boat nichola prove hostil john paul go island get fresh water doesnt want fall love milli next day john paul yanke deck milli come shore ask invit come aboard aboard begin brief voyag trip milli say envi john freedom correct invok dead wife go back island greet nichola carri conceal knife nichola john short fight end unharm john angri nichola night nichola confront milli ask marri milli say interest threaten meanwhil john still fear becom attach someon instruct paul get ship way immedi two day later chang heart steer yanke back inlet meet milli say love explain afraid nichola john convinc go wharf grandfath eight oclock night even nichola see milli litchfield attempt escap kill litchfield tie milli bed upstair gag mouth nine oclock worri fact nobodi came wharf john goe hous investig accident make nois nichola find fight meanwhil milli manag free long struggl john surviv fight unharm head wharf make safe aboard paul warn low tide boat would bare clear bar john convinc rais sail anyway nichola use gun john drop fight begin shoot boat wound paul viciou dog litchfield kept chain break free kill nichola milli manag safe steer boat past bar final scene next day john milli kiss heal paul watch

When an accident and a false accusation leads to Ben-Hur's arrest, Messala, who has become corrupt and arrogant, makes sure Ben-Hur and his family are jailed and separated.
Ben-Hur is sentenced to slave labor in a Roman war galley. Along the way, he unknowingly encounters Jesus, the carpenter's son who offers him water. Once aboard ship, his attitude of defiance and strength impresses a Roman admiral, Quintus Arrius, who allows him to remain unchained. This actually works in the admiral's favor because when his ship is attacked and sunk by pirates, Ben-Hur saves him from drowning.
Arrius then treats Ben-Hur as a son, and over the years the young man grows strong and becomes a victorious chariot racer. This eventually leads to a climactic showdown with Messala in a chariot race, in which Ben-Hur is the victor. However, Messala does not die, as he does in the more famous 1959 remake of the film.

1925,The Big Parade,American,King Vidor,"John Gilbert, Renée Adorée",war,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Parade,"In the United States in 1917, James ""Jim"" Apperson's (John Gilbert) idleness (in contrast to his hardworking brother) incurs the great displeasure of his wealthy businessman father. Then America enters World War I. Jim informs his worried mother that he has no intention of enlisting, and his father threatens to kick him out of the house if he does not join. However, when he runs into his patriotic friends at a send-off parade, he is persuaded to enlist, making his father very proud.
During training, Jim makes friendships with Southern construction worker Slim (Karl Dane) and Bronx bartender Bull (Tom O'Brien). Their unit ships out to France, where they are billeted at a farm in the village of Champillon in the Marne.
All three men are attracted to Melisande (Renée Adorée), whose mother owns the farm. She repulses all their advances, but gradually warms to Jim, bonding at first over chewing gum. They eventually fall in love, despite not being able to speak each other's language. One day, however, Jim receives a letter and a photograph from Justyn (Claire Adams), which reveals that they are engaged. When Melisande sees the picture, she realizes the situation and runs off in tears. Before Jim can decide what to do, his unit is ordered to the front. Melisande hears the commotion and races back, just in time for the lovers to embrace and kiss.
The Americans march towards the front and are strafed by an enemy fighter before it is shot down. The unit is sent to the attack immediately, advancing against snipers and machine guns in the woods, then more machine guns, artillery, and poison gas in the open. They settle down in a makeshift line. Jim shelters in a shellhole with Slim and Bull.
That night, orders come down for one man to go out and eliminate a troublesome mortar crew; Slim wins a spitting contest for the opportunity. He succeeds, but is spotted and wounded on the way back. After listening to Slim's pleas for help, Jim cannot stand it any longer and goes to his rescue against orders. Bull follows, but is shot and killed. By the time Jim reaches Slim, he is already dead. Jim is then shot in the leg. When a German (George Beranger) comes to finish him off, Jim shoots and wounds him. The German starts crawling back to his line. Jim catches up to him in another shellhole, but, face to face, cannot bring himself to finish him off with his bayonet. Instead, he gives his erstwhile enemy a cigarette. Soon after, the German dies. Fortunately for Jim, he is not stuck in no man's land for long; the Americans attack, and he is taken away to a hospital.

1925,Cobra,American,Joseph Henabery,"Rudolph Valentino, Nita Naldi",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_(1925_film),"Valentino plays Count Rodrigo Torriani, an Italian noble. A charming libertine, his weakness is women – the ""cobras"" referred to in the title of the film.
Roridgo accepts an invitation from friend Jack Dorning (Ferguson) to come to New York City to work as an antiques expert. While the job is rewarding, Rodrigo finds the temptation from the women surrounding him, including Dorning's secretary Mary Drake (Olmstead) and wife Elise (Naldi) challenging.
When Jack is away, Elise reveals to Rodrigo that she is still in love with him. The two arrange to meet at a hotel. However, at the last minute, Rodrigo remembers he cannot betray his friend and refuses to go to the rendezvous. It turns out to be a wise decision; the hotel burns to the ground in the middle of the night, killing Elise.
Rodrigo desperately wants a relationship with Mary. However, after Elise's death, he turns Mary's attentions toward Jack and decides to leave New York. The film ends with Rodrigo gazing out at the sea and the Statue of Liberty as he sets sail back to Europe.
The production of Cobra was marred by bickering and soaring production costs. Furthermore, its studio Paramount Pictures, unhappy with the final film and fearing it would flop with audiences and critics, held off releasing it until Valentino (whose popularity had declined somewhat) appeared in a stronger, unequivocally successful picture. Eventually Cobra was released in late 1925, a few weeks after what proved to be Valentino's comeback feature, The Eagle.

1925,"Don Q, Son of Zorro",American,Donald Crisp,Douglas Fairbanks,swashbuckler,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Q,_Son_of_Zorro","Don Diego de la Vega (Zorro)'s son, Cesar (Douglas Fairbanks), is in Spain finishing his education. While Cesar is showing off to friends his remarkable prowess with the whip, he accidentally clips off the feather shako on the hat of Don Sebastian (Donald Crisp) of the Palace Guard. Although Cesar apologizes immediately, Sebastian is unforgiving. Their duel is interrupted by a runaway bull. Trapped on the ground with his sword belt tangled in his boot, certain to be gored by the bull, Sebastian is saved at the last minute by Cesar. This further infuriates him. The action is observed by Queen Isabella (Stella De Lanti) and her guest, Austrian Archduke Paul (Warner Oland); she requests Cesar's company immediately. Another friend of Cesar, Don Fabrique Borusta (Jean Hersholt), offers to bring him to Her Majesty.
Meanwhile, Cesar encounters Dolores (Mary Astor), daughter of his father's old friend, General de Muro (Jack McDonald), as she poses for a sculptor. It is love at first sight. But Sebastian, who comes from a poor family, has set his sights on Dolores and her family's wealth, and is determined to win her. Later, the Archduke invites Cesar to paint the town, with Sebastian as their ""duenna."" In a local tavern the Archduke offends the patrons, all seeming ruffians, by flirting with the dancer. Sebastian contrives his and the Duke's escape, but locks Cesar in the tavern to defend himself against the cutthroats. In the carriage that takes them away from what he is sure will be Cesar's death, Sebastian declares he has a meeting with Dolores. The Archduke invites himself along. While Sebastian asks the General for his daughter's hand, the Archduke sees Dolores serenaded by Cesar, who escaped (easily) and even acquired a guitar as a souvenir. Seeing the reactions of the young couple, the Archduke knows Cesar has won Dolores's heart.
Although penniless, Don Fabrique has designs on succeeding in society. He glues together a discarded invitation to the Archduke’s Grand Ball, and crashes the party. At the ball, Cesar and Sebastian sit on either side of Dolores, both seeming frustrated in their efforts to woo her. The Archduke summons her to him. When Cesar sees the Archduke caress Dolores's cheek, Cesar becomes jealous and goes to confront him. But the Archduke assures him that he is working in Cesar's favor, and proves it by dragging Sebastian to another room to play cards while Cesar and Dolores dance together. Cesar pulls Dolores to a balcony for ardent lovemaking. Fabrique sees them; when the pair are interrupted by Dolores’s father, General de Muro, who recognizes Cesar and is ready to give his blessing, Fabrique believes they are about to be betrothed.
In the card room, the Archduke declares that Sebastian is as unlucky at cards as he is in love. Franque tiptoes in, and tells the Archduke that he saw Cesar and Dolores kissing: surely they will be married now. The Archduke summons Cesar to congratulate him, to the horror of Sebastian. When he enters, Cesar is offended at the impropriety of this news, and learns that the source was Fabrique. Such bad manners should not go unpunished. He informs the Archduke that someone here doesn't belong, and asks if he should remove him. Archduke Paul nods, and Cesar pulls Fabrique out of the room by tugging his nose.
The Archduke continues to taunt Sebastian, a foolish move when Sebastian, enraged by jealousy, pulls his sword and stabs the Archduke before he realizes what he has done. He hides when Cesar, hearing something, enters, then strikes Cesar unconscious. He frames him for the Archduke's murder, then casually leaves. With his last dying energy, the Archduke pulls a playing card off the table and writes on it: Sebastian assassinated me. Archduke Paul.
Fabrique enters, finds Cesar unconscious, finds the playing card and, miffed at Cesar's insult, takes it. Shortly thereafter he confronts Sebastian with his demands: to be appointed Civil Governor. Both stand by while the Guard arrests Cesar for the murder and orders his immediate execution to prevent an international incident. But General de Muro offers Cesar a gentleman’s way out by giving him a dagger. Cesar pretends to stab himself and falls to the moat below the castle.
Months pass, while Cesar hides in the ruins of the old family castle. He pretends to be Don Q, for ""a trick must be answered by a trick!"" Fabrique has become Civil Governor, receiving regular pay-offs from Sebastian. Fabrique has even taken over Carlo's servants, and maidservant Lola (Lottie Pickford), seeing how Sebastian behaves around Fabrique, runs to tell Cesar that although gossip says they are close friends, in truth Sebastian is afraid of Fabrique. This will prove the leverage Cesar needs to establish his innocence.
After months of mourning over Cesar, Dolores is pushed to marry Sebastian. Just as she is about to sign the marriage contract with Sebastian, Cesar appears at the window. He is alive! The Queen orders Cesar’s arrest. The best man to find him: that one-eyed ferret, Colonel Matsado (Albert MacQuarrie). But when Matsado stops at a country inn on his way into the city, Cesar waylays him, steals his uniform, and impersonates him. Back in the city Cesar as Matsado pretends to beat his (now Fabrique's) old manservant Robledo (Charles Stevens) for information on Cesar's whereabouts, then convinces Fabrique to accompany him to the ruins where Cesar has been living these past months. There he is determined to find what hold Fabrique has on Sebastian.
In a whirlwind finish, Sebastian and the real Matsado track Cesar to his lair, as do his father, Zorro (Fairbanks), who with the mute faithful family servant Bernardo (Tote Du Crow), has sailed from California to Spain to help. On the way to the ruins they pass Dolores and her mother along the same road. Finally, as all gather at the ruins, Zorro and Don Q battle the soldiers, Fabrique confesses, Sebastian is beaten, de Muro recognizes his old friend, the villains are arrested, and Cesar and Dolores reunited.",diego de la vega zorro son cesar dougla fairbank spain finish educ cesar show friend remark prowess whip accident clip feather shako hat sebastian donald crisp palac guard although cesar apolog immedi sebastian unforgiv duel interrupt runaway bull trap ground sword belt tangl boot certain gore bull sebastian save last minut cesar infuri action observ queen isabella stella de lanti guest austrian archduk paul warner oland request cesar compani immedi anoth friend cesar fabriqu borusta jean hersholt offer bring majesti meanwhil cesar encount dolor mari astor daughter father old friend gener de muro jack mcdonald pose sculptor love first sight sebastian come poor famili set sight dolor famili wealth determin win later archduk invit cesar paint town sebastian duenna local tavern archduk offend patron seem ruffian flirt dancer sebastian contriv duke escap lock cesar tavern defend cutthroat carriag take away sure cesar death sebastian declar meet dolor archduk invit along sebastian ask gener daughter hand archduk see dolor serenad cesar escap easili even acquir guitar souvenir see reaction young coupl archduk know cesar doloress heart although penniless fabriqu design succeed societi glue togeth discard invit archduk ’ grand ball crash parti ball cesar sebastian sit either side dolor seem frustrat effort woo archduk summon cesar see archduk caress doloress cheek cesar becom jealou goe confront archduk assur work cesar favor prove drag sebastian anoth room play card cesar dolor danc togeth cesar pull dolor balconi ardent lovemak fabriqu see pair interrupt dolor ’ father gener de muro recogn cesar readi give bless fabriqu believ betroth card room archduk declar sebastian unlucki card love franqu tipto tell archduk saw cesar dolor kiss sure marri archduk summon cesar congratul horror sebastian enter cesar offend improprieti news learn sourc fabriqu bad manner go unpunish inform archduk someon doesnt belong ask remov archduk paul nod cesar pull fabriqu room tug nose archduk continu taunt sebastian foolish move sebastian enrag jealousi pull sword stab archduk realiz done hide cesar hear someth enter strike cesar unconsci frame archduk murder casual leav last die energi archduk pull play card tabl write sebastian assassin archduk paul fabriqu enter find cesar unconsci find play card mif cesar insult take shortli thereaft confront sebastian demand appoint civil governor stand guard arrest cesar murder order immedi execut prevent intern incid gener de muro offer cesar gentleman ’ way give dagger cesar pretend stab fall moat castl month pass cesar hide ruin old famili castl pretend q trick must answer trick fabriqu becom civil governor receiv regular payoff sebastian fabriqu even taken carlo servant maidserv lola lotti pickford see sebastian behav around fabriqu run tell cesar although gossip say close friend truth sebastian afraid fabriqu prove leverag cesar need establish innoc month mourn cesar dolor push marri sebastian sign marriag contract sebastian cesar appear window aliv queen order cesar ’ arrest best man find oneey ferret colonel matsado albert macquarri matsado stop countri inn way citi cesar waylay steal uniform imperson back citi cesar matsado pretend beat fabriqu old manserv robledo charl steven inform cesar whereabout convinc fabriqu accompani ruin cesar live past month determin find hold fabriqu sebastian whirlwind finish sebastian real matsado track cesar lair father zorro fairbank mute faith famili servant bernardo tote du crow sail california spain help way ruin pass dolor mother along road final gather ruin zorro q battl soldier fabriqu confess sebastian beaten de muro recogn old friend villain arrest cesar dolor reunit

1925,The Freshman,American,"Fred C. Newmeyer, Sam Taylor",Harold Lloyd,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freshman_(1925_film),"Harold Lamb (Harold Lloyd), a bright-eyed but naïve young man, enrolls at Tate University. On the train there, he meets Peggy (Jobyna Ralston). They are attracted to each other.
Harold decides that the best way to ensure his popularity at school is to emulate his movie idol, The College Hero, down to mimicking a little jig he does before greeting anyone, and taking his nickname, ""Speedy"". However, the College Cad (Brooks Benedict) quickly makes him the butt of an ongoing joke, of which the freshman remains blissfully unaware. Harold thinks he is popular, when in fact he is the laughingstock of the whole school. His only real friend is Peggy, who turns out to be his landlady's daughter. She is described in one of the film's title cards as ""the kind of girl your mother must have been"".
He tries out for the football team. The coach (Pat Harmon) is unimpressed, but as Harold has damaged their only practice tackle dummy, the coach uses him in its place. At the end of practice, though, he approves of Harold's enthusiasm (undiminished after repeated tackling). The coach is about to dismiss the freshman when Chet Trask (James Anderson), the captain and star of the team, suggests making him their water boy, while letting him think he has made the squad.
Harold is persuaded to host the annual ""Fall Frolic"" dance. His tailor is late making his suit; with the dance well underway, it is barely being held together by basting stitches, but Harold puts it on and hopes for the best. During the party, his clothes start to fall apart, despite the efforts of the tailor (hiding in a side room) to effect repairs. When Harold sees the College Cad being too forward with Peggy, working as a hatcheck girl, Harold knocks him down. The incensed Cad then tells him just what everyone really thinks of him. Peggy advises him to stop putting on an act and be himself.
Harold is determined to prove himself by getting into the big football game. His chance comes when the other team proves too tough, injuring so many of Tate College's players that the coach runs out of substitutes. Hounded by Harold and warned by the referee that he will forfeit if he cannot come up with another player, the coach reluctantly lets Harold go in. The first few plays are disastrous. Finally, he breaks free and is on his way to winning the game, but, mindful of a referee's prior instruction that he is to stop playing when he hears the whistle, he drops the football just outside the end zone when a non-football whistle sounds. The other team recovers the ball with only a minute left to play. His teammates are disheartened, but Harold rouses them to make a final effort. He chases down the opposing ball carrier, knocks the football loose, scoops it up and runs it all the way back for the winning touchdown as time runs out, which at last earns him the respect and popularity he was after. To top it off, Peggy passes him a note proclaiming her love for him.",harold lamb harold lloyd brightey naïv young man enrol tate univers train meet peggi jobyna ralston attract harold decid best way ensur popular school emul movi idol colleg hero mimick littl jig greet anyon take nicknam speedi howev colleg cad brook benedict quickli make butt ongo joke freshman remain bliss unawar harold think popular fact laughingstock whole school real friend peggi turn landladi daughter describ one film titl card kind girl mother must tri footbal team coach pat harmon unimpress harold damag practic tackl dummi coach use place end practic though approv harold enthusiasm undiminish repeat tackl coach dismiss freshman chet trask jame anderson captain star team suggest make water boy let think made squad harold persuad host annual fall frolic danc tailor late make suit danc well underway bare held togeth bast stitch harold put hope best parti cloth start fall apart despit effort tailor hide side room effect repair harold see colleg cad forward peggi work hatcheck girl harold knock incens cad tell everyon realli think peggi advis stop put act harold determin prove get big footbal game chanc come team prove tough injur mani tate colleg player coach run substitut hound harold warn refere forfeit come anoth player coach reluctantli let harold go first play disastr final break free way win game mind refere prior instruct stop play hear whistl drop footbal outsid end zone nonfootbal whistl sound team recov ball minut left play teammat dishearten harold rous make final effort chase oppos ball carrier knock footbal loos scoop run way back win touchdown time run last earn respect popular top peggi pass note proclaim love
1925,Go West,American,Buster Keaton,Buster Keaton,"comedy, western",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_West_(1925_film),"A drifter identified only as ""Friendless"" (Keaton) sells the last of his possessions, keeping only a few trinkets and a picture of his mother. Unable to find a job in the city, he goes west and manages to get a job at a cattle ranch despite having no experience. Meanwhile, a neglected cow named Brown Eyes fails to give milk and is sent out to the field along with the other cattle.
As Friendless tries to figure out how to milk a cow, he's told to go out and help the other ranch hands bring in the cattle. Unsuccessful in riding a horse, he falls off and sees Brown Eyes. Noticing her limp, Friendless examines her hoof and removes the rock that had been hurting her. Brown Eyes proceeds to follow Friendless around, saving him from a bull attack. Realizing that he's finally found a companion, Friendless strikes up a friendship with the cow, giving her his blanket at night and attempting to protect her from wild dogs. The next day, Brown Eyes follows Friendless everywhere, much to the chagrin of the other ranch hands. Friendless accidentally sets two steers loose after they'd been corralled in, but on the joking suggestion of the other hands, brings them back in by waving his red bandanna.
The ranch owner (Truesdale) and his daughter (Myers) are preparing to sell the cattle to a stockyard, though another rancher wants to hold out for a higher price. The owner, no longer wanting to wait, prepares to ship the whole herd out. Friendless, shocked to hear that Brown Eyes will go to a slaughterhouse, refuses to let her go. The ranch owner fires him and gives him his wages. Friendless tries to buy his friend back with his earnings, but is told that it's not enough. After failing to get more money from a card game, he joins Brown Eyes in the cattle car and tries to find a way to free her. The train is ambushed by the other rancher and his men. Friendless and the ranch owner's other hands manage to drive off the attackers, but only Friendless makes it back to the train as the others chase away the rancher.
Arriving in Los Angeles, Friendless frees Brown Eyes and leads her away, using his red bandanna once more to guide the other thousand steers to the stockyard. The townspeople are terrified of the cattle as some of the cows break away and begin entering the stores, but Friendless manages to corral them together. Friendless ties Brown Eyes up before going back to retrieve the other cattle, leaving his red bandanna with her in order to keep her cool. Realizing his mistake, he enters a masquerade store to find something red to attract the cows. Deciding on a red devil's outfit, he exits the store and the cattle begin to chase him. The police attempt to arrest him, but are mistakenly sprayed with hoses from the fire department, who flee once they see the cattle coming.
The ranch owner, realizing his ruin if the cattle are not sold, drives with his daughter to the stockyard. The owner tells him that no cattle have arrived yet. Defeated, the ranch owner prepares to leave when he sees Friendless leading the herd into the stockyard. Overjoyed, the ranch owner tells Friendless that his house and anything he owns is his to ask for. Friendless says that he only wants ""her,"" gesturing behind him to where the ranch owner's daughter is. The owner is surprised and the daughter flattered, but they quickly realize that it's Brown Eyes that he's referring to. The three drive back to the ranch, with Brown Eyes beside Friendless in the back seat.",drifter identifi friendless keaton sell last possess keep trinket pictur mother unabl find job citi goe west manag get job cattl ranch despit experi meanwhil neglect cow name brown eye fail give milk sent field along cattl friendless tri figur milk cow he told go help ranch hand bring cattl unsuccess ride hors fall see brown eye notic limp friendless examin hoof remov rock hurt brown eye proce follow friendless around save bull attack realiz he final found companion friendless strike friendship cow give blanket night attempt protect wild dog next day brown eye follow friendless everywher much chagrin ranch hand friendless accident set two steer loos theyd corral joke suggest hand bring back wave red bandanna ranch owner truesdal daughter myer prepar sell cattl stockyard though anoth rancher want hold higher price owner longer want wait prepar ship whole herd friendless shock hear brown eye go slaughterhous refus let go ranch owner fire give wage friendless tri buy friend back earn told enough fail get money card game join brown eye cattl car tri find way free train ambush rancher men friendless ranch owner hand manag drive attack friendless make back train other chase away rancher arriv lo angel friendless free brown eye lead away use red bandanna guid thousand steer stockyard townspeopl terrifi cattl cow break away begin enter store friendless manag corral togeth friendless tie brown eye go back retriev cattl leav red bandanna order keep cool realiz mistak enter masquerad store find someth red attract cow decid red devil outfit exit store cattl begin chase polic attempt arrest mistakenli spray hose fire depart flee see cattl come ranch owner realiz ruin cattl sold drive daughter stockyard owner tell cattl arriv yet defeat ranch owner prepar leav see friendless lead herd stockyard overjoy ranch owner tell friendless hous anyth own ask friendless say want gestur behind ranch owner daughter owner surpris daughter flatter quickli realiz brown eye he refer three drive back ranch brown eye besid friendless back seat

Larsen tries to throw him out when Jim also stumbles inside.

While outside looking for food, he encounters Jim's gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns.
Meanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospector's shoes. Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him. At that moment, a bear enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food.
After the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit. There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel. While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen is swept to his death in an avalanche. Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, but he has lost his memory from the blow. When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he had found a large gold deposit, that the deposit was close to a certain cabin and that he had stayed in the cabin with the Prospector. But he knows neither the location of the deposit nor of the cabin. So, he goes looking for the Prospector, hoping that he still knows the location of the cabin.
The Prospector arrives at the town and encounters Georgia, a dance hall girl. To irritate Jack, a ladies' man who is making aggressive advances toward her and pestering her for a dance, she instead decides to dance with ""the most deplorable looking tramp in the dance hall"", the Prospector, who instantly falls in love with her. After encountering each other again, she accepts his invitation for a New Year's Eve dinner, but does not take it seriously and soon forgets about it. While waiting for her to arrive to the dinner, the Prospector imagines entertaining her with a dance of bread rolls on forks. When she does not arrive until midnight, he walks alone through the streets, desperate. At that moment, she remembers his invitation and decides to visit him. Finding his home empty but seeing the meticulously prepared dinner and a present for her, she has a change of heart and prepares a note for him in which she asks to talk to him.
When the Prospector is handed the note, he goes searching for Georgia. But at the same moment, Jim finds him and drags him away to go search for the cabin, giving the Prospector only enough time to shout to Georgia that he soon will return to her as a millionaire. Jim and the Prospector find the cabin and stay for the night. Overnight, another blizzard blows the cabin half over a cliff right next to Jim's gold deposit. The next morning the cabin rocks dangerously over the cliff edge while the two try to escape. At last Jim manages to get out and pull the Prospector to safety right when the cabin falls down the chasm.
One year later both have become wealthy. But the Prospector was not able to find Georgia. They return to the contiguous United States on a ship on which, unknown to them, Georgia is also travelling. When the Prospector agrees to don his old clothes for a photograph, he falls down the stairs, encountering Georgia once more. After she mistakes him for a stowaway and tries to save him from the ship's crew, the misunderstanding is cleared up and both are happily reunited.",follow plot 1942 rereleas big jim gold prospector klondik gold rush found enorm gold deposit parcel land blizzard strike lone prospector get lost blizzard also prospect gold stumbl cabin black larsen want crimin larsen tri throw jim also stumbl insid larsen tri scare use shotgun overpow jim three agre uneasi truce stay cabin storm take long food run three draw lot go blizzard obtain food larsen lose leav cabin outsid look food encount jim gold deposit decid ambush jim return meanwhil two remain cabin get desper cook eat one prospector shoe later jim get deliri imagin prospector giant chicken attack moment bear enter cabin kill suppli food storm subsid leav cabin prospector continu next gold boom town jim return gold deposit knock larsen shovel flee mine gold larsen swept death avalanch jim recov conscious wander snow lost memori blow return town memori partli restor rememb found larg gold deposit deposit close certain cabin stay cabin prospector know neither locat deposit cabin goe look prospector hope still know locat cabin prospector arriv town encount georgia danc hall girl irrit jack ladi man make aggress advanc toward pester danc instead decid danc deplor look tramp danc hall prospector instantli fall love encount accept invit new year eve dinner take serious soon forget wait arriv dinner prospector imagin entertain danc bread roll fork arriv midnight walk alon street desper moment rememb invit decid visit find home empti see meticul prepar dinner present chang heart prepar note ask talk prospector hand note goe search georgia moment jim find drag away go search cabin give prospector enough time shout georgia soon return millionair jim prospector find cabin stay night overnight anoth blizzard blow cabin half cliff right next jim gold deposit next morn cabin rock danger cliff edg two tri escap last jim manag get pull prospector safeti right cabin fall chasm one year later becom wealthi prospector abl find georgia return contigu unit state ship unknown georgia also travel prospector agre old cloth photograph fall stair encount georgia mistak stowaway tri save ship crew misunderstand clear happili reunit

1925,Lady Windermere's Fan,American,Ernst Lubitsch,"Ronald Colman, May McAvoy",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Windermere%27s_Fan_(1925_film),"In London, Lady Margaret Windermere is busy discouraging Lord Darlington's flirting, while her husband receives a letter from Edith Erlynne, ""a complete stranger,"" asking to meet him on a urgent matter. A woman of great beauty but terrible reputation, she reveals that she is the mother of Lady Windermere, who believes she is dead and reveres her memory. Fearing that his wife would be crushed by the truth and seeing a pile of bills on Mrs. Erlynne's desk, Lord Windermere gives her a cheque for ₤1500 for her silence.
Mrs. Erlynne resumes her scandalous lifestyle. At a horse race, she attracts the attention of many, including members of the Windermere party, notably Lord Augustus Lorton, ""London's most distinguished bachelor,"" and three snoopy, gossipy women. As Lord Windermere defends Mrs. Erlynne to the latter, his wife becomes a bit concerned. Mrs. Erlynne leaves. Lorton follows and is soon calling on her regularly.
For Lady Windermere's birthday, her husband gives her jewelry and a lovely fan. When he leaves the mansion, she and Darlington by chance see him dismiss his chauffeur and take a taxi instead. Darlington then tells her that Mrs. Erlynne's name may be found in her husband's cheque book and declares his love for her. Meanwhile, Mrs. Erlynne blackmails Lord Windermere into an invitation to a ball that night, explaining that such ""social recognition"" might help elicit a marriage proposal from Lord Lorton. When he returns home, his wife confronts him with his copy of the ₤1500 cheque, which she found after breaking into his locked desk drawer. He tells her he only helped a deserving woman in need, but she becomes further infuriated when he informs her that Mrs. Erlynne will be coming to their ball that night.
Faced with his wife's strong opposition, he sends a note to Mrs. Erlynne, asking her not to come. She does not open it, assuming it is her invitation, and goes to the ball. She is not on the guest list, but then Lord Lorton arrives, and she uses him to gain entry. She induces a reluctant Lord Windermere to formally introduce her to his wife. This awkward moment does not go unnoticed, and gossip quickly spreads. However, Mrs. Erlynne adroitly flatters the chief gossiper, and soon she is accepted by the other women guests.
Unaware of this, Lady Windermere flees to the garden. She then thinks that she sees Mrs. Erlynne flirting with her husband. In fact, she is talking to Lorton, who asks Mrs. Erlynne to marry him. Mrs. Erlynne spots Lady Windermere and tries to clear up any confusion, but Lady Windermere will not listen. Instead, she flees to Darlington's house, though the man is still at her party. Mrs. Erlynne finds her farewell note to her husband and takes it away.
At Darlington's house, she tries to persuade Lady Windermere to go home, telling her that she ruined her life in exactly the same manner. Then Darlington arrives, accompanied by Lord Windermere and some other men, the ball having ended. The two women hide in another room, but Lady Windermere forgets her fan on a sofa. Lord Windermere demands that Lord Darlington explain what his wife's fan is doing there. Mrs. Erlynne comes out and apologizes for having taken it by mistake. All the guests, notably Lord Lorton, leave. Meanwhile Lady Windermere leaves the house unseen.
The following day at breakfast, Mrs. Erlynne comes to return the fan and take leave of the Windermeres, as she is going back to France. Lady Windermere wants to tell her husband what really happened the day before, but Mrs. Erlynne dissuades her. On her way out, Mrs. Erlynne encounters Lord Lorton and tells him that she was shocked by his behavior the previous evening and that she no longer wants to marry him. He is flabbergasted, but after thinking it over, follows her into her taxi.",london ladi margaret windermer busi discourag lord darlington flirt husband receiv letter edith erlynn complet stranger ask meet urgent matter woman great beauti terribl reput reveal mother ladi windermer believ dead rever memori fear wife would crush truth see pile bill mr erlynn desk lord windermer give chequ ₤1500 silenc mr erlynn resum scandal lifestyl hors race attract attent mani includ member windermer parti notabl lord augustu lorton london distinguish bachelor three snoopi gossipi women lord windermer defend mr erlynn latter wife becom bit concern mr erlynn leav lorton follow soon call regularli ladi windermer birthday husband give jewelri love fan leav mansion darlington chanc see dismiss chauffeur take taxi instead darlington tell mr erlynn name may found husband chequ book declar love meanwhil mr erlynn blackmail lord windermer invit ball night explain social recognit might help elicit marriag propos lord lorton return home wife confront copi ₤1500 chequ found break lock desk drawer tell help deserv woman need becom infuri inform mr erlynn come ball night face wife strong opposit send note mr erlynn ask come open assum invit goe ball guest list lord lorton arriv use gain entri induc reluct lord windermer formal introduc wife awkward moment go unnot gossip quickli spread howev mr erlynn adroitli flatter chief gossip soon accept women guest unawar ladi windermer flee garden think see mr erlynn flirt husband fact talk lorton ask mr erlynn marri mr erlynn spot ladi windermer tri clear confus ladi windermer listen instead flee darlington hous though man still parti mr erlynn find farewel note husband take away darlington hous tri persuad ladi windermer go home tell ruin life exactli manner darlington arriv accompani lord windermer men ball end two women hide anoth room ladi windermer forget fan sofa lord windermer demand lord darlington explain wife fan mr erlynn come apolog taken mistak guest notabl lord lorton leav meanwhil ladi windermer leav hous unseen follow day breakfast mr erlynn come return fan take leav windermer go back franc ladi windermer want tell husband realli happen day mr erlynn dissuad way mr erlynn encount lord lorton tell shock behavior previou even longer want marri flabbergast think follow taxi
1925,Little Annie Rooney,American,William Beaudine,"Mary Pickford, William Haines",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Annie_Rooney_(1925_film),"Annie Rooney is a young girl who spends her days wreaking havoc in the tenements with a gang of children and their rival gang, the Kid Kellys. They fight in the streets, accidentally scaring a fruit vendor's horse in the process. Annie's father is a respected neighborhood police officer, but her brother, Tim, is a member of the Big Kellys, a gang of older boys led by Joe Kelly. The gang raises money for themselves by selling tickets to an upcoming dance.
Joe is kind to Annie and she develops a crush on him. But when Joe visits the Rooney home later that day, Officer Rooney warns him that if he continues to lead his gang, he will no longer allow Tim to spend time with Joe.
The fruit vendor arrives and informs Officer Rooney that Annie's activities that morning cost him five dollars' worth of fresh fruit. When each of the children claim responsibility for scaring the horse, Officer Rooney decides that they will all have to repay the fruit vendor together.
The children decide to raise funds by staging a play set in the Wild West. Prompted by teasing from a heckler, Annie attempts to ride the same horse that the children had scared earlier, but it is spooked once again and gallops through the city with Annie on its back. Joe spots Annie and manages to catch her when she falls. When the fruit vendor catches up with them, Joe pays him back with five dollars' worth of tickets to the dance.
The night of the dance is also Officer Rooney's birthday; he is on patrol outside the dance hall. Back at home, Tim and Annie are preparing for their father's return. At the dance, a fight breaks out between Joe and two of his fellow gang members, Tony and Spider. The lights in the dance hall are switched off, attracting the attention of Officer Rooney, who ventures inside. Tony fires a gun, but the bullet meant for Joe hits Officer Rooney instead, killing him.
A week passes. The police still haven't discovered Officer Rooney's killer. Tony and Spider lie to Tim, telling him that Joe killed Officer Rooney. Tim intends to take revenge himself.
Meanwhile, Annie is told that Tony was seen discarding a gun in an alley. Members of the Kid Kellys begin to suspect Tony as well. The rival gangs unite and manage to bring Tony to the police station, but Tim arrives shortly after them and announces that he has just shot Joe.
Annie rushes to the hospital and learns that Joe will die unless he is given an immediate blood transfusion. Annie volunteers, though she mistakenly believes that she will die as a result. She is tested and donates her blood. After the procedure, Annie learns that she is not going to die, and she states her intention to marry Joe one day.
Later, Joe drives Annie and her friends through town.

1925,The Lost World,American,Harry Hoyt,"Bessie Love, Wallace Beery.","fantasy, adventure",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_World_(1925_film),"From a lost expedition to a plateau in Venezuela, Paula White brings the journal of her father explorer Maple White to the eccentric Professor Challenger in London. The journal features sketches of dinosaurs which is enough proof for Challenger to publicly announce that dinosaurs still walk the earth. Met with ridicule at an academic meeting at the Zoological Hall, Challenger reluctantly accepts a newspaper's offer to finance a mission to rescue Maple White. Professor Challenger, Paula White, sportsman Sir John Roxton, news reporter Edward Malone (who is a friend of Roxton and wishes to go on the expedition to impress his fiancée), a skeptical professor Summerlee, an Indian servant Zambo, and Challenger's butler Austin leave for the plateau.
At their campsite at the base of the plateau, the explorers are shocked when a large rock falls, sent their way by an Apeman perched on top of an overhead ledge. As the crew look up to see their attacker, Challenger spies overhead a Pteranodon (mistakenly calling it a Pterodactylus) killing and eating a young Toxodon which proves that the statements in Maple White's diary are true. Leaving Zambo and Austin at the camp, they cross a chasm onto the plateau by cutting down a tree and using it as a bridge, but it is knocked over by a Brontosaurus, leaving them trapped.
The explorers witness various life-and-death struggles between the prehistoric beasts of the plateau. An Allosaurus attacks an Edmontosaurus, and knocks it into a bog. The Allosaurus then attacks, and is driven off by a Triceratops. Eventually, the Allosaurus makes its way to the campsite and attacks the exploration party. It is finally driven off by Ed who tosses a torch into its mouth. Convinced that the camp is not safe, Ed climbs a tree to look for a new location, but is attacked by the apeman. Roxton succeeds in shooting the apeman, but the creature is merely wounded and escapes before he can finish him off. Meanwhile, an Agathaumas is attacked by the Allosaurus, and gores it to death. Suddenly, a Tyrannosaurus attacks and kills the Agathaumas, along with an unfortunate Pteranodon.
The explorers then make preparations to live on the plateau potentially indefinitely. A catapult is constructed and during a search for Maple White, Roxton finds his remains, confirming his death. It is at this time that Ed confesses his love for Paula and the two are unofficially wed by Summerlee who used to be a minister.
Shortly afterwards, as the paleontologists are observing the Brontosaurus, an Allosaurus attacks it and the Brontosaurus falls off the edge of the plateau, becoming trapped in a mud bank at the base of the plateau. Soon afterwards, a volcano erupts causing a mass stampede among the giant creatures of the lost world. The crew is saved when Paula's pet monkey Jocko climbs up the plateau carrying a rope. The crew use the rope to pull up a rope ladder constructed by Zambo and Austin and then climb down.
As Ed makes his descent, he is again attacked by the apeman who pulls the rope ladder. The apeman is again shot and finally killed by Roxton. They discover the Brontosaurus that had been pushed off the plateau had landed softly in the mud of the river, trapped but still alive, and Challenger manages to bring it back to London, as he wants to put it on display as proof of his story.
However, while being unloaded from the ship it escapes and causes havoc until it reaches Tower Bridge, where its massive weight causes a collapse, and it swims down the River Thames. Challenger is morose as the creature leaves. Ed discovers that the love he left in London has married in his absence, allowing him and Paula to be together. Roxton morosely but gallantly hides his love for Paula as Paula and Ed leave together, while two passersby note: ""That's Sir John Roxton—sportsman.""",lost expedit plateau venezuela paula white bring journal father explor mapl white eccentr professor challeng london journal featur sketch dinosaur enough proof challeng publicli announc dinosaur still walk earth met ridicul academ meet zoolog hall challeng reluctantli accept newspap offer financ mission rescu mapl white professor challeng paula white sportsman sir john roxton news report edward malon friend roxton wish go expedit impress fiancé skeptic professor summerle indian servant zambo challeng butler austin leav plateau campsit base plateau explor shock larg rock fall sent way apeman perch top overhead ledg crew look see attack challeng spi overhead pteranodon mistakenli call pterodactylu kill eat young toxodon prove statement mapl white diari true leav zambo austin camp cross chasm onto plateau cut tree use bridg knock brontosauru leav trap explor wit variou lifeanddeath struggl prehistor beast plateau allosauru attack edmontosauru knock bog allosauru attack driven triceratop eventu allosauru make way campsit attack explor parti final driven ed toss torch mouth convinc camp safe ed climb tree look new locat attack apeman roxton succe shoot apeman creatur mere wound escap finish meanwhil agathauma attack allosauru gore death suddenli tyrannosauru attack kill agathauma along unfortun pteranodon explor make prepar live plateau potenti indefinit catapult construct search mapl white roxton find remain confirm death time ed confess love paula two unoffici wed summerle use minist shortli afterward paleontologist observ brontosauru allosauru attack brontosauru fall edg plateau becom trap mud bank base plateau soon afterward volcano erupt caus mass stamped among giant creatur lost world crew save paula pet monkey jocko climb plateau carri rope crew use rope pull rope ladder construct zambo austin climb ed make descent attack apeman pull rope ladder apeman shot final kill roxton discov brontosauru push plateau land softli mud river trap still aliv challeng manag bring back london want put display proof stori howev unload ship escap caus havoc reach tower bridg massiv weight caus collaps swim river thame challeng moros creatur leav ed discov love left london marri absenc allow paula togeth roxton moros gallantli hide love paula paula ed leav togeth two passersbi note that sir john roxton—sportsman

1925,Phantom of the Opera,American,Rupert Julian,"Lon Chaney, Mary Philbin, Norman Kerry",horror,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1925_film),"The film opens with the debut of the new season at the Paris Opera House, with a production of Gounod's Faust. Comte Philippe de Chagny (John St. Polis) and his brother, the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny (Norman Kerry) are in attendance. Raoul attends only in the hope of hearing his sweetheart Christine Daaé (Mary Philbin) sing. Christine has made a sudden rise from the chorus to understudy of Mme. Carlotta, the prima donna. Raoul visits her in her dressing room during the performance, and makes his intentions known that he wishes for Christine to resign and marry him. Christine refuses to let their relationship get in the way of her career.
At the height of the most prosperous season in the Opera's history, the management suddenly resign. As they leave, they tell the new managers of the Opera Ghost, a phantom who asks for opera box #5, among other things. The new managers laugh it off as a joke, but the old management leaves troubled.
After the performance, the ballerinas are disturbed by the sight of a mysterious man in a fez (Arthur Edmund Carewe), who dwells in the cellars. Arguing whether or not he is the Phantom, they decide to ask Joseph Buquet, a stagehand who has actually seen the ghost's face. Buquet describes a ghastly sight of a living skeleton to the girls, who are then startled by a shadow cast on the wall. The antics of stagehand Florine Papillon (Snitz Edwards) do not amuse Joseph's brother, Simon (Gibson Gowland), who chases him off. Meanwhile, Mme. Carlotta (Virginia Pearson), the prima donna of the Paris Grand Opera, barges into the managers' office enraged. She has received a letter from ""The Phantom,"" demanding that Christine sing the role of Marguerite the following night, threatening dire consequences if his demands are not met. Christine is in her dressing room at that moment, speaking to a phantom voice (which the audience sees as a shadow on a wall behind the dressing room.) The voice warns her that she will take Carlotta's place on Wednesday and that she is to think only of her career and her master.
The following day, in a garden near the Opera House, Raoul meets Christine and asks her to reconsider his offer. Christine admits that she has been tutored by a divine voice, the ""Spirit of Music,"" and that it is now impossible to stop her career. Raoul tells her that he thinks someone is playing a joke on her, and she storms off in anger.
Wednesday evening, Carlotta is ill and Christine takes her place in the opera. During the performance, the managers go to Box 5 to see exactly who has taken it. The keeper of the box does not know who it is, as she has never seen his face. The two managers enter the box and are startled to see a shadowy figure seated there. They run out of the box and compose themselves, but when they enter the box again, the person is gone. In her next performance, Christine reaches her triumph during the finale and receives a standing ovation from the audience. When Raoul visits her in her dressing room, she pretends not to recognize him, because unbeknownst to those in the room, the phantom voice is present. Meanwhile, Simon Buquet finds the body of his brother, Joseph, hanging by the strangler's noose and vows vengeance. Raoul spends the evening outside her door, and after the others have left, just as he is about to enter, he hears the voice within the room. He overhears the voice make his intentions to Christine: ""Soon, Christine, this spirit will take form and will demand your love!"" When Christine leaves her room alone, Raoul breaks in to find it empty. Carlotta receives another discordant note from the Phantom. Once again, it demands that she take ill and let Christine have her part. The managers also get a note, reiterating that if Christine does not sing, they will present ""Faust"" in a house with a curse on it.
The following evening, despite the Phantom's warnings, a defiant Carlotta appears as Marguerite. At first, the performance goes well, but soon the Phantom's curse takes its effect, backstage, causing the great crystal chandelier to fall down onto the audience. Christine runs to her dressing room and is entranced by a mysterious voice through a secret door behind the mirror, descending, in a dream-like sequence, semi-conscious on horseback by a winding staircase into the lower depths of the Opera. She is then taken by gondola over a subterranean lake by the masked Phantom into his lair. The Phantom introduces himself as Erik and declares his love; Christine faints, so Erik carries her to a suite fabricated for her comfort. The next day, when she awakens, she finds a note from Erik telling her that she is free to come and go as she pleases, but that she must never look behind his mask. In the next room, the Phantom is playing his composition, ""Don Juan Triumphant."" Christine's curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneaks up behind the Phantom and tears off his mask, revealing his hideously deformed face. Enraged, the Phantom makes his plans to hold her prisoner known. In an attempt to plead to him, he excuses her to visit her world one last time, with the condition that she never sees her lover again.
Released from the underground dungeon, Christine makes a rendezvous at the annual masked-ball, which is graced with the Phantom in the guise of the 'Red-Death' from the Edgar Allan Poe short story of the same name. Raoul finds Christine and they flee to the roof of the Opera House, where she tells him everything that followed the chandelier crash. However, an unseen jealous Phantom perching on the statue of Apollo overhears them. Raoul plans to whisk Christine safely away to London following the next performance. As they leave the roof, the mysterious man with the fez approaches them. Aware that the Phantom is waiting downstairs, he leads Christine and Raoul to another exit.
The following evening, Raoul meets Christine in her dressing room. She has heard the voice of the Phantom, who has revealed that he knows their plans. Raoul has arranged for a carriage and reassures her nothing will go wrong. During the performance, the Phantom kidnaps Christine off the stage during a blackout. Raoul rushes to Christine's dressing room, and meets the man in the fez, who reveals himself to be Inspector Ledoux, a secret policeman who has been studying Erik's moves as the Phantom since he escaped as a prisoner from Devil's Island. Ledoux reveals the secret door in Christine's room and the two men enter the catacombs of the Opera House in an attempt to rescue Christine. Instead, they fall into the Phantom's dungeon, a torture room of his design. Philippe has also found his way into the catacombs looking for his brother, and a clanging alarm alerts the Phantom to his presence in a canoe on the lake. Phillipe is drowned by Erik, who returns to find the two men in the torture chamber. Turning a switch, the Phantom subjects the two prisoners to intense heat; the two manage to escape the chamber by opening a door in the floor as they are about to perish. In the chamber below, the Phantom shuts a gate, locking them in with barrels full of gunpowder.
The Phantom gives Christine a choice of two levers: one shaped like a scorpion and the other like a grasshopper. One of them will save Raoul's life, but at the cost of Christine marrying Erik, while the other will blow up the barrels in the chamber Raoul and Ledoux are trapped in, in effect destroying the Opera House and killing them all. Christine picks the scorpion, but it is a trick by the Phantom to ""save"" Raoul and Ledoux from being killed by drowning them. Christine begs the Phantom to save Raoul, promising him anything in return, even becoming his wife. At the last second, the Phantom opens a trapdoor in his floor through which Raoul and Ledoux are saved.
A mob, led by Simon, infiltrates the Phantom's lair. As the clanging alarm sounds and the mob approaches, the Phantom attempts to flee with Christine in the carriage meant for Raoul and Christine. While Raoul saves Christine, the Phantom is pursued and killed by a mob, who throw him into the River Seine to finally drown. In a brief epilogue, Raoul and Christine are shown on their honeymoon in Viroflay.",film open debut new season pari opera hous product gounod faust comt philipp de chagni john st poli brother vicomt raoul de chagni norman kerri attend raoul attend hope hear sweetheart christin daaé mari philbin sing christin made sudden rise choru understudi mme carlotta prima donna raoul visit dress room perform make intent known wish christin resign marri christin refus let relationship get way career height prosper season opera histori manag suddenli resign leav tell new manag opera ghost phantom ask opera box 5 among thing new manag laugh joke old manag leav troubl perform ballerina disturb sight mysteri man fez arthur edmund carew dwell cellar argu whether phantom decid ask joseph buquet stagehand actual seen ghost face buquet describ ghastli sight live skeleton girl startl shadow cast wall antic stagehand florin papillon snitz edward amus joseph brother simon gibson gowland chase meanwhil mme carlotta virginia pearson prima donna pari grand opera barg manag offic enrag receiv letter phantom demand christin sing role marguerit follow night threaten dire consequ demand met christin dress room moment speak phantom voic audienc see shadow wall behind dress room voic warn take carlotta place wednesday think career master follow day garden near opera hous raoul meet christin ask reconsid offer christin admit tutor divin voic spirit music imposs stop career raoul tell think someon play joke storm anger wednesday even carlotta ill christin take place opera perform manag go box 5 see exactli taken keeper box know never seen face two manag enter box startl see shadowi figur seat run box compos enter box person gone next perform christin reach triumph final receiv stand ovat audienc raoul visit dress room pretend recogn unbeknownst room phantom voic present meanwhil simon buquet find bodi brother joseph hang strangler noos vow vengeanc raoul spend even outsid door other left enter hear voic within room overhear voic make intent christin soon christin spirit take form demand love christin leav room alon raoul break find empti carlotta receiv anoth discord note phantom demand take ill let christin part manag also get note reiter christin sing present faust hous curs follow even despit phantom warn defiant carlotta appear marguerit first perform goe well soon phantom curs take effect backstag caus great crystal chandeli fall onto audienc christin run dress room entranc mysteri voic secret door behind mirror descend dreamlik sequenc semiconsci horseback wind staircas lower depth opera taken gondola subterranean lake mask phantom lair phantom introduc erik declar love christin faint erik carri suit fabric comfort next day awaken find note erik tell free come go pleas must never look behind mask next room phantom play composit juan triumphant christin curios get better sneak behind phantom tear mask reveal hideous deform face enrag phantom make plan hold prison known attempt plead excus visit world one last time condit never see lover releas underground dungeon christin make rendezv annual maskedbal grace phantom guis reddeath edgar allan poe short stori name raoul find christin flee roof opera hous tell everyth follow chandeli crash howev unseen jealou phantom perch statu apollo overhear raoul plan whisk christin safe away london follow next perform leav roof mysteri man fez approach awar phantom wait downstair lead christin raoul anoth exit follow even raoul meet christin dress room heard voic phantom reveal know plan raoul arrang carriag reassur noth go wrong perform phantom kidnap christin stage blackout raoul rush christin dress room meet man fez reveal inspector ledoux secret policeman studi erik move phantom sinc escap prison devil island ledoux reveal secret door christin room two men enter catacomb opera hous attempt rescu christin instead fall phantom dungeon tortur room design philipp also found way catacomb look brother clang alarm alert phantom presenc cano lake phillip drown erik return find two men tortur chamber turn switch phantom subject two prison intens heat two manag escap chamber open door floor perish chamber phantom shut gate lock barrel full gunpowd phantom give christin choic two lever one shape like scorpion like grasshopp one save raoul life cost christin marri erik blow barrel chamber raoul ledoux trap effect destroy opera hous kill christin pick scorpion trick phantom save raoul ledoux kill drown christin beg phantom save raoul promis anyth return even becom wife last second phantom open trapdoor floor raoul ledoux save mob led simon infiltr phantom lair clang alarm sound mob approach phantom attempt flee christin carriag meant raoul christin raoul save christin phantom pursu kill mob throw river sein final drown brief epilogu raoul christin shown honeymoon viroflay

1925,The Salvation Hunters,American,Josef von Sternberg,"Georgia Hale, George K. Arthur",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Hunters,"The film opens with a foreword:
The story begins along a bleak waterfront in an unidentified harbor. Industrial refuse litters the shore. A giant Sisypheandredge scoops mud from a channel and into a massive barge. Four characters, “humans who crawl close to the earth” occupy the brooding landscape:
The Boy, a fainthearted and feckless youth, wanders aimlessly amid the wreckage. He fancies The Girl.
The Girl, older and hardened by her impoverishment, has “sunk as low as her socks.” Maintaining a sullen dignity in her solitude, she spurns The Boys diffident advances.
The Child is an orphaned youngster. He silently haunts the mud barge where his parents lost their lives.
The Brute is a man of indeterminate age and short-tempered. He acts as watchman aboard the barge.
The Brute makes a pass at The Girl. She cuts him cold with a glare and he retreats. Frustrated, The Brute assaults The Child who has trespassed on the barge. The Boy witnesses the assault, but is frozen by his cowardice. The Girl, with a single word, shames him into action. He gingerly collects The Child, and they flee together with The Brute in pursuit. The Girl, with a look, signals the dredge operator, who unleashes a torrent of mud on the head of The Brute.
The Boy, The Girl and The Child escape from the desolate docks to the slums of an unnamed metropolis.
As the threesome trudge through the back alleys of the city, they are spotted by The Man and his client, The Gentleman. The Man accosts The Boy and confirms what he suspects: they are homeless and penniless. He assures The Boy that jobs are plentiful, and offers to provide a room for the trio while The Boy seeks employment. Unbeknownst to them, the “room” is located in a brothel. The Man’s aim is to enlist The Girl as a prostitute. When they are ushered into the seedy flat, The Woman, a sex worker, attempts to provide them with some refreshment. The Man stops her: “Hunger will whisper things in their ears that I might find troublesome to say.”
As the hours pass, The Girl becomes increasingly anxious due to The Child’s pleas for food. The Boy returns from his futile search for work demoralized. They are on the verge of despair. The Boy indulges in a vivid fantasy, in which he, The Girl and The Child are transformed into wealthy aristocrats, who arrive at their estate escorted by servants dressed in faux-military livery.
The Gentlemen, with the encouragement of the Man, enters the room expecting to negotiate sex with a prostitute. The Girl coldly considers the proposition. The Boy becomes distraught when he discerns The Girl’s ambivalence. The Gentleman, grasping her dilemma, bestows a gift of money on the Girl without comment and quietly takes his leave. The Child snatches the largesse and bolts to the door, returning shortly with provisions for a meal – the crisis past.
The Man, thwarted in his endeavor, devises another plan in collusion with The Woman. They invite the young trio to an outing in the countryside. There, he intends to seduce The Girl and coerce her into the sex trade: “…let romance do a little work.”. The Woman is tasked with distracting The Boy during the seduction.
The party of five arrives in the country in a touring car. They park next to a real estate sign that reads “Here Your Dreams Come True.” Despite The Man’s best efforts, The Girl remains unresponsive to his blandishments. Exasperated, he lashes out at The Child. The Boy, shedding his fear, leaps to the defense of the little boy and beats The Man into submission with his fists. The Girl rejoices that The Boy has claimed his manhood.
Triumphantly, the trio – now a family –strides into the sunset, “children of the sun.”",film open foreword stori begin along bleak waterfront unidentifi harbor industri refus litter shore giant sisypheandredg scoop mud channel massiv barg four charact “ human crawl close earth ” occupi brood landscap boy faintheart feckless youth wander aimlessli amid wreckag fanci girl girl older harden impoverish “ sunk low sock ” maintain sullen digniti solitud spurn boy diffid advanc child orphan youngster silent haunt mud barg parent lost live brute man indetermin age shorttemp act watchman aboard barg brute make pass girl cut cold glare retreat frustrat brute assault child trespass barg boy wit assault frozen cowardic girl singl word shame action gingerli collect child flee togeth brute pursuit girl look signal dredg oper unleash torrent mud head brute boy girl child escap desol dock slum unnam metropoli threesom trudg back alley citi spot man client gentleman man accost boy confirm suspect homeless penniless assur boy job plenti offer provid room trio boy seek employ unbeknownst “ room ” locat brothel man ’ aim enlist girl prostitut usher seedi flat woman sex worker attempt provid refresh man stop “ hunger whisper thing ear might find troublesom say ” hour pass girl becom increasingli anxiou due child ’ plea food boy return futil search work demor verg despair boy indulg vivid fantasi girl child transform wealthi aristocrat arriv estat escort servant dress fauxmilitari liveri gentlemen encourag man enter room expect negoti sex prostitut girl coldli consid proposit boy becom distraught discern girl ’ ambival gentleman grasp dilemma bestow gift money girl without comment quietli take leav child snatch largess bolt door return shortli provis meal – crisi past man thwart endeavor devis anoth plan collus woman invit young trio outing countrysid intend seduc girl coerc sex trade “ …let romanc littl work ” woman task distract boy seduct parti five arriv countri tour car park next real estat sign read “ dream come true ” despit man ’ best effort girl remain unrespons blandish exasper lash child boy shed fear leap defens littl boy beat man submiss fist girl rejoic boy claim manhood triumphantli trio – famili –stride sunset “ children sun ”

A lawyer (whom they dodged, mistakenly believing he was trying to add to their woes) finally manages to inform Jimmy of the terms of his grandfather's will. He will inherit seven million dollars if he is married by 7:00 p.m. on his 27th birthday, which happens to be that same day.
Shannon immediately seeks out his sweetheart, Mary Jones, who readily accepts his proposal. However, when he clumsily explains why they have to get married that day, she breaks up with him.
He returns to the country club to break the news to his partner and the lawyer. Though Jimmy's heart is set on Mary, Meekin persuades him to try proposing to other women to save them both from ruin or even possibly jail. He has Jimmy look in the club's dining room; Jimmy knows seven women there (the chances of the title). Each turns him down. In desperation, Jimmy asks any woman he comes across. Even the hat check girl rejects him. He finally finds one who agrees, but it turns out she is underage when her mother spots her and takes her away.
Meanwhile, Mary's mother persuades her to reconsider. She writes a note agreeing to marry Jimmy and sends the hired hand to deliver it.
Unaware of this, Meekin has his partner's predicament (and potential inheritance) printed in the newspaper, asking would-be brides to go to the Broad Street Church at 5 p.m. Hordes of veiled women descend on the place. When they spot Jimmy (who had fallen asleep on a pew), they begin to fight over him. Then the clergyman appears and announces he believes it all to be a practical joke. Infuriated, the women chase after Jimmy. While hiding, he gets Mary's note. He races to Mary's house, pursued by furious females. Along the way, he accidentally starts an avalanche, which drives away the mob.
When he gets to Mary's home, Meekin shows him his watch; he is minutes too late. Mary still wants to marry him, money or no, but he refuses to let her share his impending disgrace.

1925,The Unholy Three,American,Tod Browning,"Lon Chaney, Mae Busch",crime,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unholy_Three_(1925_film),"Three performers leave a sideshow after Tweedledee (Harry Earles), the midget, assaults a young heckler and sparks a melee. The three join together in an ""unholy"" plan to become wealthy. Prof. Echo, the ventriloquist, assumes the role of Mrs. O'Grady, a kindly old grandmother, who runs a pet shop, while Tweedledee plays her grandchild. Hercules (Victor McLaglen), the strongman, works in the shop along with the unsuspecting Hector McDonald (Matt Moore). Echo's girlfriend, pickpocket Rosie O'Grady (Mae Busch), pretends to be his granddaughter.
Using what they learn from delivering pets, the trio later commit burglaries, with their wealthy buyers as victims. On Christmas Eve, John Arlington (an uncredited Charles Wellesley) telephones to complain that the ""talking"" parrot (aided by Echo's ventriloquism) he bought will not speak. When ""Granny"" O'Grady visits him to coax the bird into performing, ""she"" takes along grandson ""Little Willie"". While there, they learn that a valuable ruby necklace is in the house. They decide to steal it that night. As Echo is too busy, the other two grow impatient and decide to go ahead without him.
The next day, Echo is furious to read in the newspaper that Arlington was killed and his three-year-old daughter badly injured in the robbery. Hercules shows no remorse whatsoever, relating how Arlington pleaded for his life. When a police investigator shows up at the shop, the trio become fearful and decide to frame Hector, hiding the jewelry in his room.
Meanwhile, Hector proposes to Rosie. She turns him down, but he overhears her crying after he leaves. To his joy, she confesses she loves him, but was ashamed of her shady past. When the police take him away, Rosie tells the trio that she will exonerate him, forcing them to abduct her and flee to a mountain cabin. Echo takes along his large pet ape (who terrifies Hercules).
In the spring, Hector is brought to trial. Rosie pleads with Echo to save Hector, promising to stay with him if he does. After Echo leaves for the city, Tweedledee overhears Hercules asking Rosie to run away with him (and the loot). The midget releases the ape. Hercules kills the midget before the ape gets him.
At the trial, Echo agonizes over what to do, but finally rushes forward and confesses all. Both he and Hector are set free. When Rosie goes to Echo to keep her promise, he lies and says he was only kidding. He tells her to go to Hector. Echo returns to the sideshow, giving his spiel to the customers: ""That's all there is to life, friends, ... a little laughter ... a little tear.""",three perform leav sideshow tweedlede harri earl midget assault young heckler spark mele three join togeth unholi plan becom wealthi prof echo ventriloquist assum role mr ogradi kindli old grandmoth run pet shop tweedlede play grandchild hercul victor mclaglen strongman work shop along unsuspect hector mcdonald matt moor echo girlfriend pickpocket rosi ogradi mae busch pretend granddaught use learn deliv pet trio later commit burglari wealthi buyer victim christma eve john arlington uncredit charl wellesley telephon complain talk parrot aid echo ventriloqu bought speak granni ogradi visit coax bird perform take along grandson littl willi learn valuabl rubi necklac hous decid steal night echo busi two grow impati decid go ahead without next day echo furiou read newspap arlington kill threeyearold daughter badli injur robberi hercul show remors whatsoev relat arlington plead life polic investig show shop trio becom fear decid frame hector hide jewelri room meanwhil hector propos rosi turn overhear cri leav joy confess love asham shadi past polic take away rosi tell trio exoner forc abduct flee mountain cabin echo take along larg pet ape terrifi hercul spring hector brought trial rosi plead echo save hector promis stay echo leav citi tweedlede overhear hercul ask rosi run away loot midget releas ape hercul kill midget ape get trial echo agon final rush forward confess hector set free rosi goe echo keep promis lie say kid tell go hector echo return sideshow give spiel custom that life friend littl laughter littl tear
1925,Wizard of Oz,American,Larry Semon,Dorothy Dwan,fantasy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_(1925_film),"A toymaker (Semon) reads L. Frank Baum's book to his granddaughter. The Land of Oz is ruled by Prime Minister Kruel (Josef Swickard), aided by Ambassador Wikked (Otto Lederer), Lady Vishuss (Virginia Pearson), and the Wizard (Charles Murray), a ""medicine-show hokum hustler"". When the discontented people, led by Prince Kynd (Bryant Washburn), demand the return of the princess, who disappeared while a baby many years before, so she can be crowned their rightful ruler, Kruel has the Wizard distract them with a parlor trick: making a female impersonator (Frederick Ko Vert) appear out of a seemingly empty basket. Kruel sends Wikked on a mission.
Meanwhile, in Kansas, Dorothy (Dorothy Dwan) lives on a farm with her relatives. While Aunt Em (Mary Carr) is a kind and caring woman, Uncle Henry (Frank Alexander) is an obese man with a short temper who shows little love for his niece. He also abuses his farmhands: Snowball (credited to G. Howe Black, a stage name for Spencer Bell, who frequently appeared in Semon's films) and Hardy's and Semon's unnamed characters. The latter two are both in love with Dorothy, who favors Hardy's character. Aunt Em reveals to Dorothy that she was placed on their doorstep as a baby, along with an envelope and instructions that it be opened only when she turned 18.
On her 18th birthday, however, Wikked and his minions arrive at the farm by biplane and demand the envelope. When Uncle Henry refuses to hand it over, Wikked suborns Hardy's character by promising him wealth and Dorothy. Wikked then has Dorothy tied to a rope and raised high up a tower; his men start a fire underneath the rope. Hardy's character finds the note, but Semon's character takes it and saves Dorothy, only to have Wikked and his men capture them all at gunpoint.
Then a tornado suddenly strikes. Dorothy, the two rivals for her affections and Uncle Henry take shelter in a shed. It (and Snowball) are carried aloft and land in Oz. Dorothy finally reads the contents of the envelope; it declares that she, Princess Dorothea, is the rightful ruler of Oz. Thwarted, Kruel blames the farmhands for kidnapping her and orders the Wizard to transform them into something else, such as monkeys, which he is of course unable to do. Chased by Kruel's soldiers, Semon's character disguises himself as a scarecrow, while Hardy's improvises a costume from the pile of tin in which he is hiding. They are still eventually taken captive. During their trial, the Tin Man accuses his fellow farmhands of kidnapping Dorothy. Kynd has the Scarecrow and Snowball put in the dungeon.
Kruel makes the Tin Man ""Knight of the Garter"" and Uncle Henry the ""Prince of Whales"". Wikked suggests he retain his power by marrying Dorothy. The Wizard helps the two prisoners escape by giving Snowball a lion costume, which he uses to scare away the guards. Though the Scarecrow manages to reach Dorothy to warn her against Kruel, he is chased back down into the dungeon by the Tin Man, and ends up getting trapped inside a lion cage (with real lions) for a while. He and Snowball finally escape.
When Kynd finds Kruel trying to force Dorothy to marry him, they engage in a sword fight. When Kruel's henchmen intervene and help disarm Kynd, the Scarecrow saves Dorothy and Kynd. Defeated, Kruel claims that he took Dorothy to Kansas in order to protect her from court factions out to harm her, but she orders that he be taken away.
The Scarecrow is heartbroken to discover that Dorothy has fallen for Prince Kynd. He then flees up a tower from the Tin Man, who tries to blast him with a cannon. Snowball flies a biplane overhead, and the Scarecrow manages to grab a rope ladder dangling underneath it. However, the ladder breaks, and he falls. The scene shifts abruptly back to the little girl, who had fallen asleep. She wakes up and leaves. The grandfather reads from the book that Dorothy marries Prince Kynd and they live happily ever after.",toymak semon read l frank baum book granddaught land oz rule prime minist kruel josef swickard aid ambassador wik otto leder ladi vishuss virginia pearson wizard charl murray medicineshow hokum hustler discont peopl led princ kynd bryant washburn demand return princess disappear babi mani year crown right ruler kruel wizard distract parlor trick make femal imperson frederick ko vert appear seemingli empti basket kruel send wik mission meanwhil kansa dorothi dorothi dwan live farm rel aunt em mari carr kind care woman uncl henri frank alexand obes man short temper show littl love niec also abus farmhand snowbal credit g howe black stage name spencer bell frequent appear semon film hardi semon unnam charact latter two love dorothi favor hardi charact aunt em reveal dorothi place doorstep babi along envelop instruct open turn 18 18th birthday howev wik minion arriv farm biplan demand envelop uncl henri refus hand wik suborn hardi charact promis wealth dorothi wik dorothi tie rope rais high tower men start fire underneath rope hardi charact find note semon charact take save dorothi wik men captur gunpoint tornado suddenli strike dorothi two rival affect uncl henri take shelter shed snowbal carri aloft land oz dorothi final read content envelop declar princess dorothea right ruler oz thwart kruel blame farmhand kidnap order wizard transform someth els monkey cours unabl chase kruel soldier semon charact disguis scarecrow hardi improvis costum pile tin hide still eventu taken captiv trial tin man accus fellow farmhand kidnap dorothi kynd scarecrow snowbal put dungeon kruel make tin man knight garter uncl henri princ whale wik suggest retain power marri dorothi wizard help two prison escap give snowbal lion costum use scare away guard though scarecrow manag reach dorothi warn kruel chase back dungeon tin man end get trap insid lion cage real lion snowbal final escap kynd find kruel tri forc dorothi marri engag sword fight kruel henchmen interven help disarm kynd scarecrow save dorothi kynd defeat kruel claim took dorothi kansa order protect court faction harm order taken away scarecrow heartbroken discov dorothi fallen princ kynd flee tower tin man tri blast cannon snowbal fli biplan overhead scarecrow manag grab rope ladder dangl underneath howev ladder break fall scene shift abruptli back littl girl fallen asleep wake leav grandfath read book dorothi marri princ kynd live happili ever

1926,Bardelys the Magnificent,American,King Vidor,"John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman",romantic drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardelys_the_Magnificent,"The film is set in the reign of King Louis XIII. When Châtellerault fails to win the heart of the icy Roxalanne de Lavedan, he wagers his entire estate against that of Bardelys that Bardelys can't either. On the way to the Lavedan estate, Bardelys stumbles upon a wounded and dying man, Lesperon, who asks Bardelys to say farewell to his beloved but dies before telling him her name. Bardelys takes his papers and assumes his identity, only to find that Lesperon is a traitor to the king.
Bardelys, as Lesperon, encounters the king's soldiers who are hunting Lesperon, fights them, and escapes, badly wounded, to the castle of Lavedan. Roxalanne hides him from the king's soldiers and tends to his wounds. She nurses him to health and pledges her love, but when the guilt-ridden Bardelys refuses to marry her, and in the belief that he is betrothed to another lady, she angrily turns him over to the king's men. Bardelys, still believed to be Lesperon, is brought to trial for treason—where Châtellerault is the judge. Châtellerault refuses to admit his identity and condemns him to death.
Roxalanne finds Bardelys in prison, confesses her love, and agrees to marry Châtellerault in a desperate effort to save Bardelys' life. Bardelys escapes from the gallows just as the King arrives to confirm his identity. Châtellerault commits suicide rather than be executed by Louis' men. Roxalanne learns of the wager and, mortally insulted, refuses to believe Bardelys when he protests his love. He offers to save the life of her father, who is indicted for treason, if she agrees to marry him. She agrees. He fulfills his part of the bargain but tells her he will not require her promise of her.

1926,The Bat,American,Roland West,"Tullio Carminati, Charles Herzinger, Jewel Carmen, Louise Fazenda","mystery, thriller",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bat_(1926_film),"Gideon Bell, owner of the Favre Emeralds, receives a letter stating that the emeralds will be stolen at midnight by ""the Bat"", and that police will not be able to stop the robbery. The Bat, a figure dressed as a bat, murders Gideon and steals the emeralds. The Bat leaves a bat-shaped note for the chief of police to inform him that he will be traveling to the country. The Bat travels by car to a mansion built by Courtleigh Fleming, the president of the Oakdale Bank, who has recently been found dead in Colorado. The mansion is being rented for the summer by writer Cornelia Van Gorder, whose maid, Lizzie Allen, sets up a bear trap to catch the Bat. Richard Fleming, Courtleigh's spendthrift nephew, wishes to lease the mansion, and plans with Dr. H. E. Wells to frighten Van Gorder away.
The newspaper reports that Brooks Bailey, a cashier at Oakdale Bank, has robbed the bank of $200,000 and has disappeared. Van Gorder's niece, Miss Dale Ogden, arrives with a supposed new gardener. Van Gorder asks the gardener about his knowledge on alopecia, urticaria, and rubeola, and he answers as if the terms referred to plants rather than medical conditions. On the staircase, Richard is shot, and Miss Dale manages to snatch part of a blueprint of the house from his pocket. Detective Moletti accuses her of trying to find a supposed hidden room in the mansion that should be shown on the blueprint. Detective Anderson arrives, and the group gets a call from the house phone in the garage, which sounds like groans of distress. A circular light shines on the wall, with the shadow of a bat in its center, but after investigating, the group finds that the shape was caused by a miller moth on a car headlight.
Dr. Wells has Miss Dale recreate Richard's murder, and she notes that she tucked the blueprint in a Parker House roll on a tray, but the blueprint is now gone. The new gardener is revealed to be Brooks Bailey, and Anderson attempts to arrest him for robbery, murder, and impersonation, but Miss Dale stops him, revealing that she and Brooks are engaged. Dr. Wells searches for the hidden room by knocking on walls, which causes the others to investigate the sound, leading them to a ballroom which is supposedly haunted. The candles in the ballroom go out when lit, and a shape appears to float towards Anderson and Lizzie, but it turns out to be the Japanese butler Billy carrying a lamp. After being confronted by Moletti, Dr. Wells knocks Moletti unconscious by striking his head, and he hides Moletti's body in another room. A beaten man enters the house, and Anderson finds that he has no identification on his person.
Billy sees a mysterious figure wearing a hat, and as he leaves to tell the others, the Bat's shadow passes by the door. The Bat sets up a system of wires that attach to a light switch. Outside, Brooks sees the figure in the hat crossing the roof, and realizes that it is the supposedly dead Courtleigh Fleming. Miss Dale finds the hidden room, located behind a fireplace. The Bat confronts her, demanding the combination to the safe in the hidden room, but she escapes. Dr. Wells is accused of helping the Bat, and the Bat is soon captured and held at gunpoint. However, the Bat activates the wire system, turning off the lights and allowing himself to escape. The Bat flees outside but his leg is caught in the bear trap placed earlier by Lizzie. The others find him and remove his mask, revealing him to be Moletti. The beaten, unknown man announces that he is the true Detective Moletti, and that the man underneath the Bat's mask was merely an impersonator of Moletti.",gideon bell owner favr emerald receiv letter state emerald stolen midnight bat polic abl stop robberi bat figur dress bat murder gideon steal emerald bat leav batshap note chief polic inform travel countri bat travel car mansion built courtleigh fleme presid oakdal bank recent found dead colorado mansion rent summer writer cornelia van gorder whose maid lizzi allen set bear trap catch bat richard fleme courtleigh spendthrift nephew wish leas mansion plan dr h e well frighten van gorder away newspap report brook bailey cashier oakdal bank rob bank 200000 disappear van gorder niec miss dale ogden arriv suppos new garden van gorder ask garden knowledg alopecia urticaria rubeola answer term refer plant rather medic condit staircas richard shot miss dale manag snatch part blueprint hous pocket detect moletti accus tri find suppos hidden room mansion shown blueprint detect anderson arriv group get call hous phone garag sound like groan distress circular light shine wall shadow bat center investig group find shape caus miller moth car headlight dr well miss dale recreat richard murder note tuck blueprint parker hous roll tray blueprint gone new garden reveal brook bailey anderson attempt arrest robberi murder imperson miss dale stop reveal brook engag dr well search hidden room knock wall caus other investig sound lead ballroom supposedli haunt candl ballroom go lit shape appear float toward anderson lizzi turn japanes butler billi carri lamp confront moletti dr well knock moletti unconsci strike head hide moletti bodi anoth room beaten man enter hous anderson find identif person billi see mysteri figur wear hat leav tell other bat shadow pass door bat set system wire attach light switch outsid brook see figur hat cross roof realiz supposedli dead courtleigh fleme miss dale find hidden room locat behind fireplac bat confront demand combin safe hidden room escap dr well accus help bat bat soon captur held gunpoint howev bat activ wire system turn light allow escap bat flee outsid leg caught bear trap place earlier lizzi other find remov mask reveal moletti beaten unknown man announc true detect moletti man underneath bat mask mere imperson moletti

1926,Beau Geste,American,Herbert Brenon,"Ronald Colman, Neil Hamilton",swashbuckler,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Geste_(1926_film),"Major de Beaujolais leads a French Foreign Legion battalion across the Sahara desert to relieve Fort Zinderneuf, reportedly besieged by Arabs. When he arrives, he receives no response from the Legionnaires manning the walls, only a single shot. He realizes they are dead. The trumpeter volunteers to scale the wall and open the gate, but after waiting 15 minutes, the major climbs inside himself. He finds the dead commandant with a bayonet stuck in him and a note in his hand addressed to the chief of police of Scotland Yard which states that the writer is solely responsible for the theft of the ""Blue Water"" sapphire from Lady Patricia Brandon. Soon after, the bodies of the commandant and the man beside him disappear. Then the fort is set afire. The major sends two Americans to fetch reinforcements.
The film then flashes back fifteen years to Kent, England. The three young Geste brothers and a girl named Isobel stage a naval battle with toy ships. When John Geste is accidentally shot in the leg, Michael ""Beau"" Geste digs the bullet out, then tells John that he is worthy of a Viking's funeral. Beau burns one ship, along with a toy soldier and a ""dog"" (broken off a vase). Beau then gets Digby, his other brother, to promise to give him a Viking's funeral if he dies first.
Lady Patricia cares for the Gestes, her orphaned nephews, while Isobel is her husband's niece. She introduces them to the Rajah Ram Singh and then-Captain Henri de Beaujolais. Lady Patricia is in financial straits; her estranged husband ""has taken every penny that comes from the estate.""
After the children become adults, she receives a telegram, announcing that her husband intends to sell the ""Blue Water"", a family jewel. She has it brought to her. Someone turns out the lights and steals it. The next morning, Beau is gone, leaving Digby a note claiming to be the thief. Digby follows, writing to John that he is the culprit. John tells Isobel that he took the jewel and departs too.
John joins the Foreign Legion and is reunited with his brothers. Boldini overhears them joking about the jewel. That night, Boldini is caught stealing Beau's belt. Sergeant Lejaune decides to assign John and his American friends Hank and Buddy to Beaujolais, while he takes Beau and Digby with him to Fort Zinderneuf. Boldini tells Lejaune about the jewel, supposedly hidden in Beau's belt.
After Lieutenant Maurel dies, Lejaune assumes command. After a fortnight of Lejaune's cruelty, some of the men plot mutiny. Beau, John and three others remain loyal. Boldini tells Beau and John that Lejaune knows about the mutiny and plans to have the men kill each other so there will be no witnesses to his theft of the jewel. Lejaune arms the loyalists, then demands that Beau give him the jewel for ""safekeeping"", but is rebuffed. Lejaune captures the mutineers, but an Arab attack forces him to arm them.
After each Legionnaire is killed, Lejaune props up his body and makes it appear he is still alive. Finally, only Lejaune, Beau and John remain. Then Beau is seemingly killed. When John sees Lejaune searching Beau's body, he grabs his bayonet, but Lejaune draws his pistol and sentences him to death. Beau, barely alive, grabs Lejaune's leg, enabling John to stab him. Before dying, Beau tells John to desert and deliver a letter to their aunt. When John spots the relief force, he fires a single shot, then leaves.
Digby climbs in and finds Beau. Remembering his childhood promise, he gives his brother a Viking's funeral, with a dog (Lejaune) at his feet. Then he deserts and finds John. They run into Hank and Buddy. Five days later, they are lost, with little water and only one camel left.

In order to gain favor with local leaders, he offers food and alcohol on credit, but often refuses to collect, much to the dismay of his wife Catharine. Mathias is deeply in debt to Frantz, who seeks Mathias' businesses. He will forgive the debt if Mathias allows him to marry his daughter, Annette. Mathias refuses, and is worried about the debt which will come due soon.
One evening a Polish Jew enters Mathias' inn. The man displays a money belt filled with gold, which Mathias, having had much to drink with the man, eyes closely. When the man leaves in a blizzard, Mathias pursues and kills him; before he dies, the man shakes a set of horse bells at him. Having come into money through murder, Mathias pays off his debt, provides a dowry for his daughter to marry, and is elected burgomaster.

1926,The Black Pirate,American,Albert Parker,"Douglas Fairbanks, Billie Dove",swashbuckler,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Pirate,"The film begins with the looting of a ship already captured and badly mauled, by the pirates. After relieving the ship and crew of valuables, the pirates fire the ship, blowing up the gunpowder on board, sinking her. While the pirates celebrate, two survivors wash up on an island, an old man and his son. Before dying, the older man gives his signet ring to his son (Douglas Fairbanks). His son buries him, vowing vengeance.
The Pirate Captain and Lieutenant bring some crew to the other side of the same island to bury some of their plunder. They then plan to murder the other pirates: ""Dead men tell no tales."" But first, Fairbanks appears as the ""Black Pirate"", who offers to join their company and fight their best man to prove his worth. After much fighting, the Black Pirate kills the Pirate Captain. The Pirate Lieutenant sneers, and says there is more to being a pirate than sword tricks. To further prove his worth, the Black Pirate says he will capture the next ship of prey single-handed, which he does. He then uses his wits to prevent the pirates from blowing up the ship along with the crew and passengers, suggesting that they hold the ship for ransom.
When a woman is discovered on board, the Pirate Lieutenant claims her. In love at first sight, the Black Pirate finds a way to temporarily save her from this fate by presenting her as a ""princess"" and urging the crew to use her as a hostage to ensure their ransom will be paid, as long as she remains ""spotless and unharmed"".
The pirates cheer the Black Pirate, and want to name him captain. The Pirate Lieutenant jeers but consents to wait to see if the ransom is paid by noon the next day. However, he secretly has a confederate destroy the ransom ship later that night to ensure it will not return. Then, when the Black Pirate is caught trying to release the woman, the Pirate Lieutenant exposes him as a traitor and the pirates force him to walk the plank.
At noon the next day, with the ransom ship having failed to show, the Pirate Lieutenant goes to the woman to claim his prize. But just then, the Black Pirate, who with the help of the sympathetic one-armed pirate MacTavish had survived being sent overboard, returns leading troops to stop the pirates. After a long fight, the pirates are routed. In the end, the Black Pirate is revealed to be a Duke, and the ""Princess"" he loves a noble Lady. Even MacTavish is moved to tears of joy by the happy ending.",film begin loot ship alreadi captur badli maul pirat reliev ship crew valuabl pirat fire ship blow gunpowd board sink pirat celebr two survivor wash island old man son die older man give signet ring son dougla fairbank son buri vow vengeanc pirat captain lieuten bring crew side island buri plunder plan murder pirat dead men tell tale first fairbank appear black pirat offer join compani fight best man prove worth much fight black pirat kill pirat captain pirat lieuten sneer say pirat sword trick prove worth black pirat say captur next ship prey singlehand use wit prevent pirat blow ship along crew passeng suggest hold ship ransom woman discov board pirat lieuten claim love first sight black pirat find way temporarili save fate present princess urg crew use hostag ensur ransom paid long remain spotless unharm pirat cheer black pirat want name captain pirat lieuten jeer consent wait see ransom paid noon next day howev secretli confeder destroy ransom ship later night ensur return black pirat caught tri releas woman pirat lieuten expos traitor pirat forc walk plank noon next day ransom ship fail show pirat lieuten goe woman claim prize black pirat help sympathet onearm pirat mactavish surviv sent overboard return lead troop stop pirat long fight pirat rout end black pirat reveal duke princess love nobl ladi even mactavish move tear joy happi end
1926,The Blackbird,American,Tod Browning,"Lon Chaney, Owen Moore",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackbird,"The Blackbird (Lon Chaney) is a thief who uses a second identity when necessary. He lives above a cheap bar in the Limehouse district, where his alter ego The Bishop, is beloved among all guests, One evening, the police drop by looking for him after a robbery, and he flees to a vaudeville theater, where his ex-wife Limehouse Polly (Doris Lloyd) has an act. Since their divorce they have become bitter towards one another, but Polly is willing to admit that she once married The Blackbird 'because she saw the soul in him that he did not know he got himself'. Furthermore, she admits to her father that she is still in love with him.
The Blackbird, though, has become infatuated by Mademoiselle Fifi Lorraine (Renée Adorée), another performer and Polly's rival. He gives her a gun as a gift, explaining to her that someone as pretty as her should have a pistol or a man to protect her. Fifi prefers a diamond collar, and turns to a much wealthier guest in turn, West End Bertie (Owen Moore). The Blackbird catches him stealing a diamond collar for Fifi, but after a battle, he is the one handing it over to her. Nevertheless, Bertie wins her affection and takes her home at the end of the night.
When The Blackbird finds out that Bertie and Fifi have become engaged, he poses as The Bishop to reveal to Fifi that Bertie is a crook. Bertie admits this, but twists the story to make him look sympathetic, thereby making Fifi fall for him even more. Seeing how the plan backfired, The Blackbird turns Bertie in to a Scotland Yard inspector. Before they can get him for robbery and murder, Fifi decides to help her fiance hide, something she afterwards reveals to The Bishop. Seeing how she is now involved, The Blackbirds changes his plans and, posed as The Bishop, offers Bertie a bed in his secret room.
To drive them apart, The Bishop tells Bertie that he can not escape because the police are looking for him in the Limehouse district, and claims to Fifi that Bertie will escape that night, on his own. Fifi offers Bertie to go along, but when he responds that he is not going because of the police, she thinks that he is lying to her and starts an argument. During this, Bertie is set up to believe that Fifi told the cops on him, and she leaves in tears. Meanwhile, Polly finds out that the police are also looking for The Blackbird for killing a Scotland Yarder.
Just as The Blackbird and Fifi are about to kiss, Polly drops by to share the terrible news. Realizing the setting she has walked in, she turns her back on The Blackbird, which causes him to respond in anger, thereby scaring off Fifi. At that moment, the police barges in. The Blackbird is able to dress himself up as The Bishop, but falls and breaks his back during the process, thereby actually becoming crippled. When Polly is asked to burn his clothes, she realizes that The Blackbird and The Bishop are the same. In the end, Fifi and Bertie are reunited. With Polly's help, The Blackbird is able to trick the police for a final time, but he dies in the aftermath.",blackbird lon chaney thief use second ident necessari live cheap bar limehous district alter ego bishop belov among guest one even polic drop look robberi flee vaudevil theater exwif limehous polli dori lloyd act sinc divorc becom bitter toward one anoth polli will admit marri blackbird saw soul know got furthermor admit father still love blackbird though becom infatu mademoisel fifi lorrain rené adoré anoth perform polli rival give gun gift explain someon pretti pistol man protect fifi prefer diamond collar turn much wealthier guest turn west end berti owen moor blackbird catch steal diamond collar fifi battl one hand nevertheless berti win affect take home end night blackbird find berti fifi becom engag pose bishop reveal fifi berti crook berti admit twist stori make look sympathet therebi make fifi fall even see plan backfir blackbird turn berti scotland yard inspector get robberi murder fifi decid help fianc hide someth afterward reveal bishop see involv blackbird chang plan pose bishop offer berti bed secret room drive apart bishop tell berti escap polic look limehous district claim fifi berti escap night fifi offer berti go along respond go polic think lie start argument berti set believ fifi told cop leav tear meanwhil polli find polic also look blackbird kill scotland yarder blackbird fifi kiss polli drop share terribl news realiz set walk turn back blackbird caus respond anger therebi scare fifi moment polic barg blackbird abl dress bishop fall break back process therebi actual becom crippl polli ask burn cloth realiz blackbird bishop end fifi berti reunit polli help blackbird abl trick polic final time die aftermath
1926,La Bohème,American,King Vidor,"Lillian Gish, John Gilbert, Renée Adorée",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boh%C3%A8me_(1926_film),"Several struggling bohemians try to survive in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the winter of 1830, hoping to one day become famous. Playwright Rodolphe (John Gilbert) and his painter roommate Marcel (Gino Corrado) have trouble with Bernard (Eugene Pouyet), the landlord, who threatens to throw them out if they do not come up with the monthly rent that night. Rodolphe reluctantly starts writing an overdue article for a journal editor to earn some money, but the editor rejects his work. With the help of their friends, musician Schaunard (George Hassell) and bookish Colline (Edward Everett Horton), they are able to raise the money.
Their next door neighbor, Mimi (Lillian Gish), an orphaned, friendless embroiderer, has the same problem. Bernard is attracted to her, but when she does not respond to his overture, he issues the same threat. She takes her meager belongings to the municipal pawnshop, but does not receive enough money to pay the rent. On her way back, she is nearly run over (deliberately) by the carriage of the rich, idle aristocrat Vicomte Paul (Roy D'Arcy). She has to fend off his advances.
When Marcel is invited to dinner by his girlfriend and downstairs neighbor, Musette (Renée Adorée), he persuades her to allow Schaunard to join them. Then the musician gets her to include Colline, who asks for Rodolphe. Rodolphe misses his cue to join the festivities in order to become acquainted with Mimi. Seeing how cold she is, he invites her to warm herself in his apartment. Later, after she vacates her room, Rodolphe entices her to share in the food Musette has provided. Then Vicomte Paul comes over. She thinks he wants some embroidery done, not realizing he has baser motives. Rodolphe does and immediately becomes jealous of the aristocrat. In any case, Mimi is able to pay her rent and stay.
In spring, Mimi joins her friends out in the country for her very first picnic. She and the love-smitten Rodolphe wander away. After a while, she admits that she loves him. This inspires Rodolphe to write a play. When Mimi takes his latest, long overdue article to his editor, she is requested to tell him that he is discharged. Wanting Rodolphe to continue working undisturbed on his play, she works secretly at night to keep up the deception that he still has a paying job. The strain, however, makes her sick.
When Vicomte Paul comes to pick up Mimi's handiwork, she tells him of Rodolphe's new play. Still hoping to seduce her, he offers to show it to a theatrical manager, if she will come with him to the theatre. Rodolphe sees them together and, in a rage, accuses Mimi of having an affair. She tries to explain, but he refuses to listen.
Rodolphe tries to forget Mimi. When he runs into the editor, he is surprised to hear he was fired five weeks ago. Meanwhile, Mimi, with Musette's help, dresses up and goes with Vicomte Paul to the theatre, hoping to get Rodolphe's play accepted. She once again rejects the vicomte's advances. Returning home, she is confronted by Rodolphe. She admits having worked in secret for him. He initially forgives her, until he finds out that she went out with Vicomte Paul and jumps to the conclusion she got the money from him. He hits her, but soon apologizes when he discovers she is very sick.
Rodolphe goes to find a doctor, but she leaves before they return, explaining in a letter that she will come back when his play is a success. He searches for her for months. Out of his anguish, a new and greater play is born. This turns out to be a hit, but he is miserable without Mimi. Meanwhile, Mimi is toiling in the slums of Paris, but the hard work is too much for the frail woman. She collapses. The doctor tells her coworkers she will not live out the night. She stumbles out into the street and eventually reaches her old apartment. Rodolphe is ecstatic to see her. Their friends, however, realize her condition. While he goes to fetch her pet bird, she tells Musette she is happy, before dying.",sever struggl bohemian tri surviv latin quarter pari winter 1830 hope one day becom famou playwright rodolph john gilbert painter roommat marcel gino corrado troubl bernard eugen pouyet landlord threaten throw come monthli rent night rodolph reluctantli start write overdu articl journal editor earn money editor reject work help friend musician schaunard georg hassel bookish collin edward everett horton abl rais money next door neighbor mimi lillian gish orphan friendless embroider problem bernard attract respond overtur issu threat take meager belong municip pawnshop receiv enough money pay rent way back nearli run deliber carriag rich idl aristocrat vicomt paul roy darci fend advanc marcel invit dinner girlfriend downstair neighbor musett rené adoré persuad allow schaunard join musician get includ collin ask rodolph rodolph miss cue join festiv order becom acquaint mimi see cold invit warm apart later vacat room rodolph entic share food musett provid vicomt paul come think want embroideri done realiz baser motiv rodolph immedi becom jealou aristocrat case mimi abl pay rent stay spring mimi join friend countri first picnic lovesmitten rodolph wander away admit love inspir rodolph write play mimi take latest long overdu articl editor request tell discharg want rodolph continu work undisturb play work secretli night keep decept still pay job strain howev make sick vicomt paul come pick mimi handiwork tell rodolph new play still hope seduc offer show theatric manag come theatr rodolph see togeth rage accus mimi affair tri explain refus listen rodolph tri forget mimi run editor surpris hear fire five week ago meanwhil mimi musett help dress goe vicomt paul theatr hope get rodolph play accept reject vicomt advanc return home confront rodolph admit work secret initi forgiv find went vicomt paul jump conclus got money hit soon apolog discov sick rodolph goe find doctor leav return explain letter come back play success search month anguish new greater play born turn hit miser without mimi meanwhil mimi toil slum pari hard work much frail woman collaps doctor tell cowork live night stumbl street eventu reach old apart rodolph ecstat see friend howev realiz condit goe fetch pet bird tell musett happi die

1926,Flesh and the Devil,American,Clarence Brown,"John Gilbert, Greta Garbo",melodrama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh_and_the_Devil,"The film is a romantic melodrama[1] about two childhood friends, Leo and Ulrich, who grow up to be soldiers in Germany. Leo becomes infatuated with Felicitas, the wife of a powerful count (a marriage about which Felicitas neglects to inform Leo). The count calls for a duel of honor with Leo, but insists that it be done under the false pretense that the quarrel was due to angry words exchanged between the two at a card game in order to protect the count's reputation. Leo kills the count in the duel, but then is punished by the military, being sent away to Africa for five years.
Due to Ulrich's intervention, Leo only serves three years before being recalled home. On his return journey he focuses on his dream of being reunited with Felicitas. Before he left for Africa, Leo had asked Ulrich to take care of Felicitas' needs while he was away. Ulrich — unaware that his friend is in love with Felicitas — falls in love with her and marries her.
Upon his return, Leo finds himself torn between Felicitas — which the woman encourages — and his friendship for Ulrich. Condemned by a local pastor for continuing to associate with Felicitas, Leo eventually loses control of his emotions, leading to a climactic duel between the two boyhood friends. While racing to stop the duel, Felicitas falls through a layer of thin ice and drowns. Meanwhile, the friends reconcile, realizing that their friendship is more important than Felicitas.",film romant melodrama1 two childhood friend leo ulrich grow soldier germani leo becom infatu felicita wife power count marriag felicita neglect inform leo count call duel honor leo insist done fals pretens quarrel due angri word exchang two card game order protect count reput leo kill count duel punish militari sent away africa five year due ulrich intervent leo serv three year recal home return journey focus dream reunit felicita left africa leo ask ulrich take care felicita need away ulrich — unawar friend love felicita — fall love marri upon return leo find torn felicita — woman encourag — friendship ulrich condemn local pastor continu associ felicita leo eventu lose control emot lead climact duel two boyhood friend race stop duel felicita fall layer thin ice drown meanwhil friend reconcil realiz friendship import felicita
1926,For Heaven's Sake,American,Sam Taylor,"Harold Lloyd, Jobyna Ralston",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Heaven%27s_Sake_(1926_film),"Millionaire J. Harold Manners (Harold Lloyd) finds himself in the poor part of town one day. When he accidentally sets fire to a charity pushcart dispensing free coffee and owned by do-gooder Brother Paul (Paul Weigel), he pulls out his checkbook to cover the damage. Brother Paul, who was talking to another person about his dream to build a mission, assumes he wants to pay for the mission and tells him $1000. Though he finds that a rather hefty amount for a mere pushcart, Manners pays without complaint.
Once Manners reads in the newspaper that he is sponsoring a mission, he goes there to dissociate himself from it. He is aghast to find it named the J. Harold Manners Mission. When he starts to tear down the sign, he is scolded by Brother Paul's daughter, Hope (Jobyna Ralston), who does not know who he is. Far from being offended, he is smitten with her. Thus, when Brother Paul returns and invites him inside to tour the place, he readily accepts. Hope, once she learns his identity, apologizes.
In order to build up attendance, Manners runs through town provoking people, and winds up with a crowd chasing him right into the mission. Some of the men are in possession of the proceeds of a jewel robbery. Before they can beat him up, however, the police arrive. The quick-witted Manners takes up a ""collection""; the crooks deposit their loot in the hat he is using while the police search everybody. This act earns him the friendship of the gang.
He eventually wins the girl and they decide to get married at the mission. His high-brow friends decide to kidnap him, believing they are saving him from a terrible mistake. As they drive away, one of them tells the wedding's ""reception committee"" that Manners is not going to marry Hope. The disappointed committeemen get drunk. Then their leader decides to go to Manner's club to confirm the news. They free Manners and head back to the mission.

1926,The General,American,"Clyde Bruckman, Buster Keaton","Buster Keaton, Marion Mack",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_(1926_film),"Western & Atlantic Railroad train engineer Johnnie Gray (Keaton) is in Marietta, Georgia to see one of the two loves of his life, his fiancée Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack)—the other being his locomotive, The General—when the American Civil War breaks out. He hurries to be first in line to enlist in the Confederate Army, but is rejected because he is too valuable in his present job; unfortunately, Johnnie is not told this reason and is forcibly ejected. On leaving, he runs into Annabelle's father and brother, who beckon to him to join them in line, but he sadly walks away, giving them the impression that he does not want to enlist. Annabelle coldly informs Johnnie that she will not speak to him again until he is in uniform.
A year passes, and Annabelle receives word that her father has been wounded. She travels north on the W&ARR with The General pulling the train to see him but still wants nothing to do with Johnnie. When the train makes a stop, the passengers detrain for a quick meal. As planned, Union spies led by Captain Anderson (Glen Cavender) use the opportunity to steal the train. Anderson's objective is to burn all the railroad bridges he passes, thus preventing reinforcement and resupply of the Confederate army facing Union General Parker's army. Annabelle becomes an inadvertent prisoner of the raiders.
Johnnie gives chase, first on foot, then by handcar and boneshaker bicycle, before reaching a station in Chattanooga. He alerts the army detachment there, which boards another train to give chase, with Johnnie manning the locomotive, Texas. However, the flatcars are not hooked up to the engine, and the troops are left behind. By the time Johnnie realizes he is alone, it is too late to turn back.
The Union agents try a variety of methods to shake their dogged pursuer (convinced he is accompanied by Confederate soldiers), including disconnecting their trailing car and dropping railroad ties on the tracks. As the unusual duel continues northward, the Confederate Army of Tennessee is ordered to retreat and the Northern army advances in its wake. Johnnie finally notices he is surrounded by Union soldiers and the hijackers see that Johnnie is by himself. Johnnie stops the Texas and runs into the forest to hide.
At nightfall, Johnnie stumbles upon the Northern encampment. Hungry, he climbs through a window to steal some food, but hides underneath the table when some officers enter. He overhears their plan for a surprise attack and that the Rock River Bridge is essential for their supply trains to support the attack. He then sees Annabelle brought in; she is taken to a room under guard while they decide what to do with her. Johnnie manages to knock out both guards and free Annabelle. They escape into the woods under cover of a rainstorm.
The next day, Johnnie and Annabelle find themselves near a railway station, where Union soldiers and equipment are being organized for the attack. Seeing The General, Johnnie devises a plan to warn the South. After sneaking Annabelle onto a boxcar behind The General, Johnnie steals his engine back. Two Union trains, including the Texas, set out after the pair, while the Union attack is immediately launched. In a reversal of the first chase, Johnnie now has to fend off his pursuers. Finally, he starts a fire behind The General in the center of the Rock River Bridge to cut off his pursuers and the Union's important supply line.
Reaching friendly lines, Johnnie warns the local Confederate commander of the impending attack. Confederate forces rush to defend the bridge. Meanwhile, Annabelle is reunited with her convalescing father. The Texas drives onto the burning bridge, which collapses (in what would later come to be recognized as the most expensive stunt of the silent era).[4] Union soldiers try to ford the river, but Confederate fire drives them back.
Afterward, Johnnie returns to his locomotive to find the Union officer whom he had knocked out earlier in order to escape regaining consciousness. He takes the officer prisoner and is spotted by the general leaving the locomotive with him. As a reward for his bravery, he is commissioned a lieutenant and given the captured officer's sword.
Returning to The General with Annabelle, he tries to kiss his girl but has to return the salutes of troops walking past. Johnnie finally uses his left hand to embrace Annabelle while using his right to blindly salute the passing soldiers while he kisses her as the screen fades to black.",western atlant railroad train engin johnni gray keaton marietta georgia see one two love life fiancé annabel lee marion mack—th locomot general—when american civil war break hurri first line enlist confeder armi reject valuabl present job unfortun johnni told reason forcibl eject leav run annabel father brother beckon join line sadli walk away give impress want enlist annabel coldli inform johnni speak uniform year pass annabel receiv word father wound travel north warr gener pull train see still want noth johnni train make stop passeng detrain quick meal plan union spi led captain anderson glen cavend use opportun steal train anderson object burn railroad bridg pass thu prevent reinforc resuppli confeder armi face union gener parker armi annabel becom inadvert prison raider johnni give chase first foot handcar boneshak bicycl reach station chattanooga alert armi detach board anoth train give chase johnni man locomot texa howev flatcar hook engin troop left behind time johnni realiz alon late turn back union agent tri varieti method shake dog pursuer convinc accompani confeder soldier includ disconnect trail car drop railroad tie track unusu duel continu northward confeder armi tennesse order retreat northern armi advanc wake johnni final notic surround union soldier hijack see johnni johnni stop texa run forest hide nightfal johnni stumbl upon northern encamp hungri climb window steal food hide underneath tabl offic enter overhear plan surpris attack rock river bridg essenti suppli train support attack see annabel brought taken room guard decid johnni manag knock guard free annabel escap wood cover rainstorm next day johnni annabel find near railway station union soldier equip organ attack see gener johnni devis plan warn south sneak annabel onto boxcar behind gener johnni steal engin back two union train includ texa set pair union attack immedi launch revers first chase johnni fend pursuer final start fire behind gener center rock river bridg cut pursuer union import suppli line reach friendli line johnni warn local confeder command impend attack confeder forc rush defend bridg meanwhil annabel reunit convalesc father texa drive onto burn bridg collaps would later come recogn expens stunt silent era4 union soldier tri ford river confeder fire drive back afterward johnni return locomot find union offic knock earlier order escap regain conscious take offic prison spot gener leav locomot reward braveri commiss lieuten given captur offic sword return gener annabel tri kiss girl return salut troop walk past johnni final use left hand embrac annabel use right blindli salut pass soldier kiss screen fade black

When she learns that a chorus girl has been fired from the Folies Barbes revue managed by Victor Renal (Ronald Colman), she sets out to fulfill her dream and apply for the job. Poverty stricken, she spends her rent money to buy suitable clothes. She gets kicked out the first time, as she was not sent by the Agency, but manages to sneak back in. While waiting in the reception area, she is mistaken for the secretary by an Agency applicant, who gives Kiki her letter of recommendation to present to Renal. He mistakes it for Kiki's, and gives her an audition. Her singing talent gets her the job.
Her debut, however, is a disaster. She repeatedly gets in the way of the show's star and Renal's fiancée, Paulette Mascar (Gertrude Astor). Paulette finally pushes her, sending her crashing into a harp in the orchestra pit. When Renal tries to separate the battling women, Paulette slaps him.
Renal also sends Kiki a letter of dismissal. When she comes to see him, he feels sorry for her and gives her back her job. He tries to hustle her out of his office, before Paulette enters, but Kiki refuses to leave. As a result, Paulette and Renal have a falling-out.
Renal decides to take Kiki to dinner. Paulette goes out with Renal's financial backer, Baron Rapp (Marc McDermott), and ends up at the same restaurant. Determined to humiliate her rival, Paulette invites herself to Renal's table and taunts Kiki into drinking several glasses of champagne. Kiki becomes drunk, embarrassing Renal. He deposits her in his limousine and asks where she lives. As she has been evicted for not paying the rent, she confesses she has no place to go, so he takes her home.
He kisses her, but when he tries for more, she locks herself in his bedroom. He is forced to sleep (uncomfortably) in another room. Each day, Renal decides to get rid of her, but each night he relents. Meanwhile, Kiki intercepts Paulette's daily letters to him to prevent a reconciliation.
Renal finally learns about the letters from Rapp. Rapp recommends he get back together with Paulette and offers to take Kiki off his hands. Kiki mistakenly believes that Renal wants Paulette back, while Renal thinks in error that Kiki welcomes Rapp's attentions and greater wealth. Kiki decides to go, taking only what she came with, but then changes her mind and decides to fight for her love. After she threatens Paulette with a knife, Renal orders her to leave. Thinking quickly, Kiki pretends to fall into a coma, convincing a doctor that she is a victim of catalepsy, which the doctor states might last up to two years. Upon hearing this, Rapp makes a hasty departure. Despite Paulette's urging to leave for a performance, Renal decides he cannot leave Kiki alone.

1926,Looking for Trouble,American,Robert North Bradbury,"Jack Hoxie, Marceline Day",western,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Trouble,"A telephone line repairman named Joe Graham (Spencer Tracy) lives in Los Angeles. One night he's offered a promotion but declines telling his boss he's happy being a ""trouble shooter"" working out in the field solving problems for a living.
Later Joe’s co-worker and partner Dan Sutter cannot work the night shift, and Joe has to work with a new repairman called Casey, who has an aptitude for practical jokes. Joe and Casey run into some odd things during their shift, finding a corpse at the place of their first assignment.
When the shift is over, both men go for a drink, and they find their colleague Dan very drunk in a casino. This night the police are on their way to raid the casino, but Casey hears about the raid and manages to warn both his colleagues and the casino owner, causing the raid to be a complete failure.
The next day both Casey and Joe are accused of tipping off the owner and causing the raid to be unsuccessful. In an attempt to exculpate himself, Joe tells his boss about the reason for their involvement in the events, and about Dan’s visit to the casino. The result is that Dan is fired from his position without notice.
Joe has been involved with one of the company’s switchboard operators, Ethel Greenwood. They split up after he suspected her of dating his partner Dan one night when Joe was working overtime. Now he reconciles with her and they go back together. However, soon after they are reunited, Dan tells Ethel about how he got fired from work, and Ethel is upset with Joe for causing it. They break up again.
Joe and Ethel don’t see each other for a while, but he hears she quit her job and started working for another company together with Dan. It turns out the office where they work is a cover-up for a racketeering operation, run by two men by the name of George and Max. Their illegal business idea consists of tapping into the phone lines of a nearby investment company to get secret stock tips.
Joe is unaware of this sly operation, until one day when he and Casey are sent to investigate the investment company’s phone lines. They have complained about the lines malfunctioning, and when Joe sees the tap he discloses the racketeering operation. Joe catches Dan red handed, as he is trying to get into the investment company’s vaults and steal the contents.
The police are notified, and the robbery in progress is stopped, but Dan manages to escape from the crime scene. Joe tips off the police about Dan and they go to his apartment. When they arrive, Ethel is there to meet up with Dan for their trip to Mexico with the bounty from the robbery. Ethel finds Dan shot and killed in the apartment and comes running out into the street in a state of complete hysteria. When the police catch her, she has a check from Dan’s bosses in her hand, and it has Dan’s fingerprints all over it. Ethel is arrested for killing Dan and being an accomplice in the racketeering operation.
Joe is doubtful of Ethel’s involvement in the illegal business, and he doesn’t believe she killed Dan. He decides to find Dan’s other girlfriend and partner in crime, Pearl Latour. Joe searches all over Long Beach to find her, and eventually he does. Pearl confesses to Joe that she indeed killed Dan, and that the reason was that he was trying to trick her and take the money that was hers. While Joe and Pearl are still talking, an earthquake shakes the whole area, and the house where they are caves in from the shaking. Pearl doesn’t escape the house in time and is buried under the masses, but is still alive. To get Pearl’s story about how she killed Dan, Joe and Casey manage to use an emergency phone line to contact her under the debris. Pearl’s last confession is then heard by the police, and Ethel is released.
Before Joe can take Pearl in, however, a huge earthquake hits Long Beach, and Pearl is buried in debris. Joe and Casey rig an emergency phone line, and police Captain Flynn records Pearl's dying confession. Ethel is cleared of all suspicions and released from jail. Upon her release Ethel and Joe are both guests at Casey and his fiancee Maizie’s wedding at city hall, at which Ethel persuades Joe to get a marriage license of his own.[2]",telephon line repairman name joe graham spencer traci live lo angel one night he offer promot declin tell boss he happi troubl shooter work field solv problem live later joe ’ cowork partner dan sutter work night shift joe work new repairman call casey aptitud practic joke joe casey run odd thing shift find corps place first assign shift men go drink find colleagu dan drunk casino night polic way raid casino casey hear raid manag warn colleagu casino owner caus raid complet failur next day casey joe accus tip owner caus raid unsuccess attempt exculp joe tell boss reason involv event dan ’ visit casino result dan fire posit without notic joe involv one compani ’ switchboard oper ethel greenwood split suspect date partner dan one night joe work overtim reconcil go back togeth howev soon reunit dan tell ethel got fire work ethel upset joe caus break joe ethel ’ see hear quit job start work anoth compani togeth dan turn offic work coverup racket oper run two men name georg max illeg busi idea consist tap phone line nearbi invest compani get secret stock tip joe unawar sli oper one day casey sent investig invest compani ’ phone line complain line malfunct joe see tap disclos racket oper joe catch dan red hand tri get invest compani ’ vault steal content polic notifi robberi progress stop dan manag escap crime scene joe tip polic dan go apart arriv ethel meet dan trip mexico bounti robberi ethel find dan shot kill apart come run street state complet hysteria polic catch check dan ’ boss hand dan ’ fingerprint ethel arrest kill dan accomplic racket oper joe doubt ethel ’ involv illeg busi ’ believ kill dan decid find dan ’ girlfriend partner crime pearl latour joe search long beach find eventu pearl confess joe inde kill dan reason tri trick take money joe pearl still talk earthquak shake whole area hous cave shake pearl ’ escap hous time buri mass still aliv get pearl ’ stori kill dan joe casey manag use emerg phone line contact debri pearl ’ last confess heard polic ethel releas joe take pearl howev huge earthquak hit long beach pearl buri debri joe casey rig emerg phone line polic captain flynn record pearl die confess ethel clear suspicion releas jail upon releas ethel joe guest casey fiance maizi ’ wed citi hall ethel persuad joe get marriag licens own2
1926,The Magician,American,Rex Ingram,"Alice Terry, Paul Wegener",horror,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(1926_film),"In the Latin Quarter of Paris, sculptor Margaret Dauncey is injured when the top of the huge statue of a faun she is working on breaks off and falls on her. After successful surgery by brilliant Dr. Arthur Burdon saves her from paralysis, she and Burdon fall in love.
The surgery is watched by various doctors and others, including Oliver Haddo, a hypnotist, magician and student of medicine (a character in Maugham's original novel based on real-life occultist Aleister Crowley). Later, in the Library of the Arsenal, Haddo finds what he has been searching for: a magic formula for the creation of human life. One of the ingredients is the ""heart blood of a Maiden"". He rips out the page and presents the old book to Dr. Porhoet, Margaret's uncle and guardian, who has also been looking for it.
When Margaret, Burdon and Dr. Porhoet go to the Fair at Leon de Belfort, they encounter Haddo, whom Margaret dislikes immediately. When Dr. Porhoet claims that the snake charmers use harmless snakes, Haddo refutes him and demonstrates his powers by letting a deadly horned viper bite him. He then magically makes the wound disappear. Porhoet remains unconvinced until the discarded viper strikes a young woman performer. Burdon has to rush her to a hospital.
Later, Haddo visits Margaret uninvited. He hypnotizes her and tells her to concentrate on her statue. It seems to come to life to preside over an orgy. Critic Carlos Clarens calls this the high point of the film: ""a nightmarish sequence in which the hypnotised heroine (Alice Terry) see herself in the midst of an orgiastic rite presided over by Pan himself, a prancing naked satyr played by Stowitts, the American dancer at the Folies Bergere.""[3]
Two days before her wedding to Burdon, Margaret receives a note from Haddo, asking her to see him the next morning. She tries to resist the summons, but fails. On the day of the wedding, Burdon learns that Margaret has married Haddo instead. Porhoet is convinced it was against his niece's will, and Burdon tries to track them down.
Burdon eventually encounters the couple at a casino in Monte Carlo. He and Porhoet free Margaret while Haddo is away. Porhoet places her in a sanatorium to recover.
Haddo, however, finds her and takes her to his laboratory in a tower. Burdon and Porhoet employ a guide to take them there. Just as Haddo is about to stab a bound Margaret, Burdon bursts in. After a violent struggle, Haddo falls into a huge fire and is killed. Margaret emerges from her trance and is reunited with her true love. Porhoet finds the page with the formula.

1926,Mare Nostrum,American,Rex Ingram,"Antonio Moreno, Alice Terry",spy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Nostrum_(film),"As a young boy growing up in a Spanish family with a long and very distinguished maritime tradition, Ulysses Ferragut is regaled with tales of the sea by his retired uncle, the ""Triton"" (Apollon), and is particularly fascinated by his claim to have once seen the sea goddess Amphitrite. Though his lawyer father, Don Esteban, wants him to follow in his footsteps, Ulysses becomes a sailor.
When he is a grown man (Antonio Moreno), Ulysses uses his life savings to purchase the Mare Nostrum, a fast, modern freighter, and prospers. However, he finally gives in to his wife, Dona Cinta, for the sake of their son Esteban, and agrees to sell his ship. With the outbreak of World War I, however, the enormous profits to be made from the sudden demand for shipping ends this plan.
On a stop in Italy, Ulysses visits the ruins of Pompeii, and meets Freya Talberg (Alice Terry) and the learned Doctor Fedelmann. He soon falls in love with Freya (who looks exactly like his uncle's painting of Amphitrite). Though she later informs him that she is an Austrian spy (as is Fedelmann), Spain is neutral and his ardor is undiminished. He agrees to transport Count Kaledine to a secret rendezvous in the Mediterranean. The U-boat U-35 surfaces, takes on fuel from Ulysses' ship, and departs with Kaledine.
Meanwhile, young Esteban leaves home without permission to find his father. After a week waiting for Ulysses at his lodgings, Esteban goes back to Barcelona aboard the Californian, a British passenger ship. However, the boy is killed when the Californian is sunk by the U-35. Ulysses learns of his son's fate from a survivor, and realizes to his grief his role in the tragedy. He vows to avenge his boy.
Upon hearing of the death, Freya sends Ulysses a letter denouncing the barbarity of the act; it is intercepted by Doctor Fedelmann. That, along with Freya's admission she has fallen in love with Ulysses, convinces Fedelmann that her subordinate can no longer be trusted. She sends Freya to Marseilles, intending to betray her to the French. Freya suspects as much, and begs Ulysses to take her to safety aboard his ship. Ulysses is torn, but a vision of his son shaking his head makes him refuse. Freya is later captured, convicted, and shot by a firing squad at dawn.
As he is leaving Freya's apartment, Ulysses encounters Count Kaledine. After a brief struggle, he chases Kaledine through the streets, gathering a mob. Kaledine is caught and taken into custody.
Ulysses then employs the Mare Nostrum in the service of the Allies, arming her with a deck gun, replacing his crew with French military sailors, and transporting munitions to Salonica. Only longtime family friend and sea cook Caragol refuses to leave him. On the voyage, they are intercepted by the U-35. With the Mare Nostrum torpedoed and doomed, Ulysses mans the abandoned deck gun and sinks the U-35. As Ulysses descends into the ocean depths, Amphitrite rises to embrace and kiss him.",young boy grow spanish famili long distinguish maritim tradit ulyss ferragut regal tale sea retir uncl triton apollon particularli fascin claim seen sea goddess amphitrit though lawyer father esteban want follow footstep ulyss becom sailor grown man antonio moreno ulyss use life save purchas mare nostrum fast modern freighter prosper howev final give wife dona cinta sake son esteban agre sell ship outbreak world war howev enorm profit made sudden demand ship end plan stop itali ulyss visit ruin pompeii meet freya talberg alic terri learn doctor fedelmann soon fall love freya look exactli like uncl paint amphitrit though later inform austrian spi fedelmann spain neutral ardor undiminish agre transport count kaledin secret rendezv mediterranean uboat u35 surfac take fuel ulyss ship depart kaledin meanwhil young esteban leav home without permiss find father week wait ulyss lodg esteban goe back barcelona aboard californian british passeng ship howev boy kill californian sunk u35 ulyss learn son fate survivor realiz grief role tragedi vow aveng boy upon hear death freya send ulyss letter denounc barbar act intercept doctor fedelmann along freya admiss fallen love ulyss convinc fedelmann subordin longer trust send freya marseil intend betray french freya suspect much beg ulyss take safeti aboard ship ulyss torn vision son shake head make refus freya later captur convict shot fire squad dawn leav freya apart ulyss encount count kaledin brief struggl chase kaledin street gather mob kaledin caught taken custodi ulyss employ mare nostrum servic alli arm deck gun replac crew french militari sailor transport munit salonica longtim famili friend sea cook caragol refus leav voyag intercept u35 mare nostrum torpedo doom ulyss man abandon deck gun sink u35 ulyss descend ocean depth amphitrit rise embrac kiss

1926,Sparrows,American,William Beaudine,"Mary Pickford, Roy Stewart, Gustav von Seyffertitz",unknown,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrows_(1926_film),"Mr. Grimes and his wife operate a dismal ""baby farm"" near an alligator-infested swamp. Molly, an adolescent inmate and the oldest of their charges, attempts to provide the other tattered, starving kids with the loving maternal care they need. Most of the children are orphans. One mother sends her child a doll, but Grimes crushes its head and tosses it into the swamp.
The children are ordered to hide anytime someone comes to the farm. When a hog buyer shows up, Ambrose, the Grimes' son, maliciously prevents Splutters, one of the children, from hiding. The buyer then purchases the boy from Grimes.
Molly has promised the others that God will rescue them. When a boy asks why nothing has happened after a month, she tells him that He is busy attending to sparrows (a biblical reference).
Ambrose catches Molly with stolen potatoes, so she and the others are given no supper. She pleads for the children, especially the sick, youngest baby, to no avail. Late that night, in a vision, Christ enters the barn where they sleep and takes the baby. When Molly wakes up, the child is dead.
Joe Bailey and his associate bring a kidnapped baby girl to the farm for concealment until they receive a ransom from the rich father, Dennis Wayne. When Grimes reads about the kidnapping in the newspaper several days later, he decides it is safer to chuck the baby into the swamp.
When Ambrose grabs the little girl to carry out the plan, Molly gets her back. After she fights off Grimes with a pitchfork, he strands her in the hayloft and decides he must get rid of her, too.
That night, Molly flees with the children. Grimes finds this hilarious; he figures either the mud or the alligators will take care of the children. However, when the kidnappers come back for the baby, he leads them on a search.
Meanwhile, Splutters is brought to the police station, having been discovered by one of the search parties. He tells the policemen and Mr. Wayne about the baby farm.
Molly and the kids emerge unscathed from the swamp and hide aboard a boat, unaware it belongs to the kidnappers. Pursued by the police, Grimes runs into the swamp, but falls into deep mud and perishes, while the two criminals flee in the boat. Unable to shake the harbor patrol, they try to slip away in a dinghy, but are run over and drown.
The baby is reunited with her wealthy father, but when she refuses to drink her milk without Molly, Mr. Wayne offers Molly a comfortable home.

1926,The Temptress,American,"Fred Niblo, Mauritz Stiller","Greta Garbo, Antonio Moreno",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temptress,"The story opens in Paris at a masquerade ball where the unhappy Elena (Garbo) meets Manuel Robledo (Antonio Moreno), an Argentine engineer. After removing their masks, they spend the night together in a park and they fall in love under the stars. They declare their love for one another, with Manuel giving her a ring, before departing.
The next day when he goes to visit his friend, Marques De Torre Bianca (Armand Kaliz), Manuel is stunned to learn that his wife happens to be Elena. He is disillusioned and upset. Wanting nothing more to do with her, he leaves.
At a dinner party, Fontenoy (Marc MacDermott), a middle-aged banker permitted by Bianca to have Elena be his mistress in order for them to be financially secure, distracts the guests by making a startling speech around the table on how Elena, the temptress, has ruined his life and blames her for his financial ruin. As he drains his glass he collapses at the table after taking his drink that was evidently filled with poison.
Back at their home, the Marquis, who had encouraged his wife's affair with Fontenoy, informs Elena that he too is overwhelmed with debt. Distraught over the incident and the departure of Robledo back, she empties her jewel box, giving all that she received from Fontenoy to the Marquis. Robledo arrives to comfort his friend and tell him that he is returning to Argentina. As he is leaving, Elena tries to convince him that she really does love him, but he doesn't love her and departs quickly.
When Robledo returns to Argentina, he receives a difficult reception from the whole town, especially associates Canterac (Lionel Barrymore) & Pirovani (Robert Anderson). We learn that these men have escaped their financial troubles and women back home by traveling to this remote country to spearhead the construction of a dam. Their efforts are being stalled by a local bandit, Manos Duras (Roy D'Arcy), and his men.
The Marquis shows up to visit Robledo in Argentina, and he has brought Elena. He tells Robledo he had no choice since she financed the trip. Elena dresses formally for dinner and every other occasion, showing up the local shoeless women and entrancing all the men much to the disdain of Robledo. Manos, who observed her arrival, comes to Robledo’s one evening to serenade Elena. He becomes jealous and he fights Manos to protect her honour. Even though they use whips, with which Manos is a master, Robledo wins. After Manos leaves, Elena tends to Robledo's wounds, and he denies that his actions were a sign that he loves her. And Manos, still seething from his loss in the fight, returns to shoot Robledo but kills the Marquis instead.
Free from marriage, Elena has distracted the men. Robledo's associates Canterac & Pirovani have even forgotten about their women back home. One night, the town throws a party in her honor, during which Canterac kills Pirovani with his sword over Elena. Manos, who had not lost sight of the larger fight of stopping the foreigners from completing their project, chooses that night to seek his revenge and dynamite the dam, producing some early special effects for 1926.
Robledo and the men attempt to repair the damage before it floods. However, they are not successful and a tired, nearly drowned Robledo returns to find Elena. Though at first he tries to kill her, he finds that he cannot and, with his resistance low, he succumbs, declaring that he is beaten and that he does love her. As he sleeps, and though she had insisted to Robledo that she had never used the word ""love"" with anyone else, she leaves him, with a note telling him that she will not be his ruin.
Six years later, the dam is completed and the engineer Robledo is back in Paris being lauded for his success by a crowd of people, with his fiancée on his arm. As they are climbing into a cab, however, Robledo sees a woman in the crowd that he thinks is Elena. He follows her, finding her in a cafe, where he buys her a drink. He is surprised that she doesn't seem to remember him, and soon leaves. Elena then has a vision, that a man across the cafe is actually Jesus Christ, halo and all. It is then revealed that she has kept Robledo's ring, the one he had given her that first night they met. She gives it to the man and the film ends with her walking away, alone down the street.
In an alternate ending, Robledo spots Elena while at an awards ceremony and the two reconcile.[2]",stori open pari masquerad ball unhappi elena garbo meet manuel robledo antonio moreno argentin engin remov mask spend night togeth park fall love star declar love one anoth manuel give ring depart next day goe visit friend marqu de torr bianca armand kaliz manuel stun learn wife happen elena disillus upset want noth leav dinner parti fontenoy marc macdermott middleag banker permit bianca elena mistress order financi secur distract guest make startl speech around tabl elena temptress ruin life blame financi ruin drain glass collaps tabl take drink evid fill poison back home marqui encourag wife affair fontenoy inform elena overwhelm debt distraught incid departur robledo back empti jewel box give receiv fontenoy marqui robledo arriv comfort friend tell return argentina leav elena tri convinc realli love doesnt love depart quickli robledo return argentina receiv difficult recept whole town especi associ canterac lionel barrymor pirovani robert anderson learn men escap financi troubl women back home travel remot countri spearhead construct dam effort stall local bandit mano dura roy darci men marqui show visit robledo argentina brought elena tell robledo choic sinc financ trip elena dress formal dinner everi occas show local shoeless women entranc men much disdain robledo mano observ arriv come robledo ’ one even serenad elena becom jealou fight mano protect honour even though use whip mano master robledo win mano leav elena tend robledo wound deni action sign love mano still seeth loss fight return shoot robledo kill marqui instead free marriag elena distract men robledo associ canterac pirovani even forgotten women back home one night town throw parti honor canterac kill pirovani sword elena mano lost sight larger fight stop foreign complet project choos night seek reveng dynamit dam produc earli special effect 1926 robledo men attempt repair damag flood howev success tire nearli drown robledo return find elena though first tri kill find resist low succumb declar beaten love sleep though insist robledo never use word love anyon els leav note tell ruin six year later dam complet engin robledo back pari laud success crowd peopl fiancé arm climb cab howev robledo see woman crowd think elena follow find cafe buy drink surpris doesnt seem rememb soon leav elena vision man across cafe actual jesu christ halo reveal kept robledo ring one given first night met give man film end walk away alon street altern end robledo spot elena award ceremoni two reconcile2
1926,Torrent,American,Monta Bell,"Greta Garbo, Ricardo Cortez",romance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_(1926_film),"The wealthy matriarch Doña Bernarda Brull (Mattox) is irritated by her son Rafael's infatuation with the orange farmer's (Edward Connelly) daughter, Leonora (Garbo). She forbids him to see her, something that causes Leonora great heartache, to say nothing of her family's financial condition. Using the singing talent cultivated by her wannabe father Pedro, Leonora leaves her humble home to later become a sensation on the stages of Paris, as La Brunna, where nobleman and other rich gentleman express their approval of her ""talents"".
Meanwhile, back in their small Spanish town of Alcira, Valencia where Leonora's father has died, Doña Bernarda Brull's domineering influence has brought Rafael to the brink of being elected to office. She's also arranged for her son to marry the wealthy Remedios Matías (Gertrude Olmstead), the daughter of a rich hog farmer (Mack Swain). However, just before both of these events are realized, La Brunna returns to her humble beginnings to visit her mother Pepa (Lucy Beaumont) and barber friend Cupido (Lucien Littlefield). Incognito, she gives Rafael the impression that she is still poor, and nearly destitute. When the proud soon-to-be-elected official visits Cupido, Leonora reveals that she is the famous La Brunna. Naturally, he is irresistibly drawn to her, which though it doesn't keep his inevitable election from happening, it does threaten his marriage to Remedios ... that is until his mother intervenes once again. Some time after the flood (the torrent), though not on that particular night, Leonora and Rafael spend a night of passion together amidst the orange groves, Doña Bernarda Brull visits Pepa to tell her of the shame which has been brought upon her home.
La Brunna returns to her life on the stage in Madrid while Rafael marries Remedios. Shortly afterwards however, Rafael follows his Leonara to declare his undying love for her once again, seemingly ready to throw away his life for her. She is thrilled and, with her maid (Lillian Leighton), packs her bags to await his return. Rafael's wise lawyer friend Don Andrés (Tully Marshall) intervenes on behalf of his mother and the community he serves to convince him to do otherwise, and Leonora is alone again.
Years pass and a much-older-looking Rafael visits La Brunna, who doesn't appear to have aged since last they met.

1927,The Cat and the Canary,American,Paul Leni,"Laura La Plante, Forrest Stanley, Creighton Hale","comedy, horror, mystery",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_and_the_Canary_(1927_film),"In a decaying mansion overlooking the Hudson River, millionaire Cyrus West approaches death. His greedy family descends upon him like ""cats around a canary"", causing him to become insane. West orders that his last will and testament remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death. As the appointed time arrives, West's lawyer, Roger Crosby (Tully Marshall), discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe. The second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled. The caretaker of the West mansion, Mammy Pleasant (Martha Mattox), blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of Cyrus West, a notion that the astonished Crosby quickly rejects.
As midnight approaches, West's relatives arrive at the mansion: nephews Harry Blythe (Arthur Edmund Carewe), Charles ""Charlie"" Wilder, Paul Jones, his sister Susan Sillsby (Flora Finch) and her niece Cecily Young (Gertrude Astor), and niece Annabelle West. Cyrus West's fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name West: Annabelle. The will, however, stipulates that to inherit the fortune, she must be judged sane by a doctor, Ira Lazar (Lucien Littlefield). If she is deemed insane, the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will. The fortune includes the West diamonds which her uncle hid years ago. Annabelle realizes that she is now like her uncle, ""in a cage surrounded by cats.""
While the family prepares for dinner, a guard (George Siegmann) barges in and announces that an escaped lunatic called the Cat is either in the house or on the grounds. The guard tells Cecily, ""He's a maniac who thinks he's a cat, and tears his victims like they were canaries!"" Meanwhile, Crosby suspects someone in the family might try to harm Annabelle and decides to inform her of her successor. Before he speaks the person's name, a hairy hand with long nails emerges from a secret passage in a bookshelf and pulls him in, terrifying Annabelle. When she explains what happened to Crosby, the family immediately concludes that she is insane.
Alone in her assigned room, Annabelle examines a note slipped to her which reveals the location of the family jewels, fashioned into an elaborate necklace. She follows the note's instructions and soon discovers the hiding place, in a secret panel above the fireplace. She retires for the night, wearing the diamond-encrusted necklace and begins to toss and turn.
While Annabelle sleeps, the same mysterious hand emerges from the wall behind her bed and snatches the diamonds from her neck. Once again, her sanity is questioned, but as Harry and Annabelle search the room, they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of Roger Crosby. Mammy Pleasant leaves to call the police, while Harry searches for the guard; Susan runs away in hysterics and hitches a ride with a milkman (Joe Murphy). Paul and Annabelle return to her room to search for the missing envelope, and discover that Crosby's body is missing. Paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him. Wandering in the hidden passages, Paul is attacked by the Cat and left for dead. He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle. The police arrive and arrest the Cat, who is Charlie Wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice. Wilder is the person named in the second will; he hoped to drive Annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance.",decay mansion overlook hudson river millionair cyru west approach death greedi famili descend upon like cat around canari caus becom insan west order last testament remain lock safe go unread 20th anniversari death appoint time arriv west lawyer roger crosbi tulli marshal discov second mysteri appear safe second may open term first fulfil caretak west mansion mammi pleasant martha mattox blame manifest second ghost cyru west notion astonish crosbi quickli reject midnight approach west rel arriv mansion nephew harri blyth arthur edmund carew charl charli wilder paul jone sister susan sillsbi flora finch niec cecili young gertrud astor niec annabel west cyru west fortun bequeath distant rel bear name west annabel howev stipul inherit fortun must judg sane doctor ira lazar lucien littlefield deem insan fortun pass person name second fortun includ west diamond uncl hid year ago annabel realiz like uncl cage surround cat famili prepar dinner guard georg siegmann barg announc escap lunat call cat either hous ground guard tell cecili he maniac think he cat tear victim like canari meanwhil crosbi suspect someon famili might tri harm annabel decid inform successor speak person name hairi hand long nail emerg secret passag bookshelf pull terrifi annabel explain happen crosbi famili immedi conclud insan alon assign room annabel examin note slip reveal locat famili jewel fashion elabor necklac follow note instruct soon discov hide place secret panel fireplac retir night wear diamondencrust necklac begin toss turn annabel sleep mysteri hand emerg wall behind bed snatch diamond neck saniti question harri annabel search room discov hidden passag wall corps roger crosbi mammi pleasant leav call polic harri search guard susan run away hyster hitch ride milkman joe murphi paul annabel return room search miss envelop discov crosbi bodi miss paul vanish secret passag close behind wander hidden passag paul attack cat left dead regain conscious time rescu annabel polic arriv arrest cat charli wilder disguis guard accomplic wilder person name second hope drive annabel insan could receiv inherit

The silent film adds considerably to the material in Watkins' play, some additions based on the original murder, and some for Hollywood considerations. The murder, which occurs in a very brief vignette before the play begins, is fleshed out considerably. Also, Roxie's husband Amos Hart (played by Victor Varconi) has a much more sympathetic and active role in the film than he does either in the play or in the subsequent musical. The ending is crueler to Roxie, in keeping with Hollywood values of not allowing criminals to profit too much from their crimes (although she does get away with murder).",plot film drawn play chicago maurin dalla watkin turn base true stori beulah annan fiction roxi hart phylli haver spectacular murder boyfriend silent film add consider materi watkin play addit base origin murder hollywood consider murder occur brief vignett play begin flesh consider also roxi husband amo hart play victor varconi much sympathet activ role film either play subsequ music end crueler roxi keep hollywood valu allow crimin profit much crime although get away murder

Most of their friends have cynical attitudes towards love and marriage, but Jean and Ted are more serious. In fact, Jean has fallen in love with Ted, who one day proposes marriage. Knowing, however, that Ted's father was unfaithful to his wife and irresponsible, Jean demands that he prove himself before she accepts his proposal. Soon Ted starts a business and opens up an office in the building where their mutual friend Kitty Flanders (Clara Bow) works. Kitty is also a child of divorce.
One evening, Kitty throws a wild party at work, and Ted takes part in the revelry. At the party, Kitty meets Prince Ludovico de Saxe (Einar Hanson) and is immediately attracted to him. The prince returns her affection, but the prince's guardian Duke Henri de Goncourt (Norman Trevor) prevents them from seeing each other because she is not of their social class. Raised by a mother who insisted that she marry a wealthy man, Kitty soon sets her sights on Ted—even though she knows that Ted and her close friend Jean love each other. One evening, after going on a drunken spree, Kitty tricks Ted into marrying her, even though she does not love him.
Desperately unhappy, Ted assures Jean that he will seek a divorce as soon as possible. Not wanting him to repeat the mistakes of their parents, Jean refuses to marry him if he divorces, and sails off for Europe. The arrival of their baby does little for their marriage, and Ted avoids spending any time with his unwanted wife. Sometime later, Kitty and Ted and their child visit the prince, whom Kitty once loved. Kitty remembers her feelings for the prince and dreams of marrying him someday. When she learns that he can never marry a divorced woman for religious reasons, she poisons herself.

1927,The Jazz Singer,American,Alan Crosland,"Al Jolson, May McAvoy",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jazz_Singer,"Cantor Rabinowitz wants his son to carry on the generations-old family tradition and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish ghetto of Manhattan's Lower East Side. But down at the beer garden, thirteen-year-old Jakie Rabinowitz is performing so-called jazz tunes. Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie's father, who drags him home. Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, ""I'll teach him better than to debase the voice God gave him!"" Jakie threatens: ""If you whip me again, I'll run away — and never come back!"" After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. At the Yom Kippur service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, ""My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight – but now I have no son."" As the sacred Kol Nidre is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.
About 10 years later, Jakie has changed his name to the more assimilated Jack Robin. Jack is called up from his table at a cabaret to perform on stage.
Jack wows the crowd with his energized rendition. Afterward, he is introduced to the beautiful Mary Dale, a musical theater dancer. ""There are lots of jazz singers, but you have a tear in your voice,"" she says, offering to help with his budding career. With her help, Jack eventually gets his big break: a leading part in the new musical April Follies.
Back at the family home Jack left long ago, the elder Rabinowitz instructs a young student in the traditional cantorial art. Jack appears and tries to explain his point of view, and his love of modern music, but the appalled cantor banishes him: ""I never want to see you again — you jazz singer!"" As he leaves, Jack makes a prediction: ""I came home with a heart full of love, but you don't want to understand. Some day you'll understand, the same as Mama does.""
Two weeks after Jack's expulsion from the family home and 24 hours before opening night of April Follies on Broadway, Jack's father falls gravely ill. Jack is asked to choose between the show and duty to his family and faith: in order to sing the Kol Nidre for Yom Kippur in his father's place, he will have to miss the big premiere.
That evening, the eve of Yom Kippur, Yudleson tells the Jewish elders, ""For the first time, we have no Cantor on the Day of Atonement."" Lying in his bed, weak and gaunt, Cantor Rabinowitz tells Sara that he cannot perform on the most sacred of holy days: ""My son came to me in my dreams—he sang Kol Nidre so beautifully. If he would only sing like that tonight—surely he would be forgiven.""
As Jack prepares for a dress rehearsal by applying blackface makeup, he and Mary discuss his career aspirations and the family pressures they agree he must resist. Sara and Yudleson come to Jack's dressing room to plea for him to come to his father and sing in his stead. Jack is torn. He delivers his blackface performance (""Mother of Mine, I Still Have You""), and Sara sees her son onstage for the first time. She has a tearful revelation: ""Here he belongs. If God wanted him in His house, He would have kept him there. He's not my boy anymore—he belongs to the whole world now.""
Afterward, Jack returns to the Rabinowitz home. He kneels at his father's bedside and the two converse fondly: ""My son—I love you."" Sara suggests that it may help heal his father if Jack takes his place at the Yom Kippur service. Mary arrives with the producer, who warns Jack that he'll never work on Broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. Jack can't decide. Mary challenges him: ""Were you lying when you said your career came before everything?"" Jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: ""I haven't sung Kol Nidre since I was a little boy."" His mother tells him, ""Do what is in your heart, Jakie—if you sing and God is not in your voice — your father will know."" The producer cajoles Jack: ""You're a jazz singer at heart!""
At the theater, the opening night audience is told that there will be no performance. Jack sings the Kol Nidre in his father's place. His father listens from his deathbed to the nearby ceremony and speaks his last, forgiving words: ""Mama, we have our son again."" The spirit of Jack's father is shown at his side in the synagogue. Mary has come to listen. She sees how Jack has reconciled the division in his soul: ""a jazz singer—singing to his God.""
""The season passes—and time heals—the show goes on."" Jack, as ""The Jazz Singer,"" is now appearing at the Winter Garden theater, apparently as the featured performer opening for a show called Back Room. In the front row of the packed theater, his mother sits alongside Yudleson. Jack, in blackface, performs the song ""My Mammy"" for her and for the world.",cantor rabinowitz want son carri generationsold famili tradit becom cantor synagogu jewish ghetto manhattan lower east side beer garden thirteenyearold jaki rabinowitz perform socal jazz tune moisha yudelson spot boy tell jaki father drag home jaki cling mother sara father declar ill teach better debas voic god gave jaki threaten whip ill run away — never come back whip jaki kiss mother goodby true word run away yom kippur servic rabinowitz mourn tell fellow celebr son stand side sing tonight – son sacr kol nidr sung jaki sneak back home retriev pictur love mother 10 year later jaki chang name assimil jack robin jack call tabl cabaret perform stage jack wow crowd energ rendit afterward introduc beauti mari dale music theater dancer lot jazz singer tear voic say offer help bud career help jack eventu get big break lead part new music april folli back famili home jack left long ago elder rabinowitz instruct young student tradit cantori art jack appear tri explain point view love modern music appal cantor banish never want see — jazz singer leav jack make predict came home heart full love dont want understand day youll understand mama two week jack expuls famili home 24 hour open night april folli broadway jack father fall grave ill jack ask choos show duti famili faith order sing kol nidr yom kippur father place miss big premier even eve yom kippur yudleson tell jewish elder first time cantor day aton lie bed weak gaunt cantor rabinowitz tell sara perform sacr holi day son came dreams—h sang kol nidr beauti would sing like tonight—sur would forgiven jack prepar dress rehears appli blackfac makeup mari discuss career aspir famili pressur agre must resist sara yudleson come jack dress room plea come father sing stead jack torn deliv blackfac perform mother mine still sara see son onstag first time tear revel belong god want hous would kept he boy anymore—h belong whole world afterward jack return rabinowitz home kneel father bedsid two convers fondli son—i love sara suggest may help heal father jack take place yom kippur servic mari arriv produc warn jack hell never work broadway fail appear open night jack cant decid mari challeng lie said career came everyth jack unsur even replac father havent sung kol nidr sinc littl boy mother tell heart jakie—if sing god voic — father know produc cajol jack your jazz singer heart theater open night audienc told perform jack sing kol nidr father place father listen deathb nearbi ceremoni speak last forgiv word mama son spirit jack father shown side synagogu mari come listen see jack reconcil divis soul jazz singer—sing god season passes—and time heals—th show goe jack jazz singer appear winter garden theater appar featur perform open show call back room front row pack theater mother sit alongsid yudleson jack blackfac perform song mammi world
1927,The Kid Brother,American,"Lewis Milestone, J. A. Howe, Ted Wilde",Harold Lloyd,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kid_Brother,"The Hickorys are a respected family in Hickoryville. Sheriff Jim and his big, strong sons Leo and Olin have little respect for the youngest son, Harold, who does not have their muscles.
When Jim, Leo and Olin go to an important town meeting to discuss a dam, Harold is left behind. He puts on his father's gun and badge and is mistaken for the sheriff by ""Flash"" Farrell, who runs a traveling medicine show for Mary after the death of her father. Farrell talks Harold into signing a permit to let him, strongman Sandoni and dancer Mary perform. Later, Mary tries to avoid the unwanted attentions of Sandoni and encounters Harold. They are attracted to each other.
When Jim finds out that Harold authorized the medicine show, he orders his son to shut down the performance. Harold tries, but Farrell makes a fool of him, then has him tied up. Harold's sworn enemy, Hank Hooper, pelts him and accidentally starts a fire that consumes the medicine show wagon. Harold invites Mary to spend the night in the family home. Jim is asleep, so Harold cannot get his permission; Harold has to use his wits to overcome the opposition of his brothers. However, Mrs. Hooper and her son Hank show up and take Mary with them, as it would not be decent for Mary to spend the night in a house without ""womenfolk"".
The next day is a town celebration, where Jim is supposed to turn over to a state official the funds raised by the residents to help build the dam. However, the money is gone. Jim strongly suspects Farrell and Sandoni of being responsible, but Sam Hooper accuses him of the theft and refuses to let him go after them. Jim sends Leo and Olin, but not Harold, after them. When they return empty-handed, Jim allows himself to be tied up. There is talk of lynching.
Harold confesses to Mary that he is not the person he pretended to be, but she tells him she has faith in him. Then Hank accuses her of being in on the robbery. Harold fights back when some men grab her, only to have Hank knock him out and set him adrift in a rowboat. He awakens after the boat reaches an abandoned, beached ship. Aboard he finds the real thieves. Sandoni disposes of Farrell after they argue over the division of the loot. Then the strongman spots Harold and chases him all over the ship. Eventually, Harold subdues Sandoni and races back to town with his prisoner and the money to save his father. An impressed Jim tells him, ""Son, you're a real Hickory."" As Harold and Mary walk away, they encounter Hank. Harold musters the courage to fight his longtime nemesis and beats him up.",hickori respect famili hickoryvil sheriff jim big strong son leo olin littl respect youngest son harold muscl jim leo olin go import town meet discuss dam harold left behind put father gun badg mistaken sheriff flash farrel run travel medicin show mari death father farrel talk harold sign permit let strongman sandoni dancer mari perform later mari tri avoid unwant attent sandoni encount harold attract jim find harold author medicin show order son shut perform harold tri farrel make fool tie harold sworn enemi hank hooper pelt accident start fire consum medicin show wagon harold invit mari spend night famili home jim asleep harold get permiss harold use wit overcom opposit brother howev mr hooper son hank show take mari would decent mari spend night hous without womenfolk next day town celebr jim suppos turn state offici fund rais resid help build dam howev money gone jim strongli suspect farrel sandoni respons sam hooper accus theft refus let go jim send leo olin harold return emptyhand jim allow tie talk lynch harold confess mari person pretend tell faith hank accus robberi harold fight back men grab hank knock set adrift rowboat awaken boat reach abandon beach ship aboard find real thiev sandoni dispos farrel argu divis loot strongman spot harold chase ship eventu harold subdu sandoni race back town prison money save father impress jim tell son your real hickori harold mari walk away encount hank harold muster courag fight longtim nemesi beat
1927,The King of Kings,American,Cecil B. DeMille,"H. B. Warner, Dorothy Cumming, Joseph Schildkraut",biblical drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Kings_(1927_film),"We see Mary Magdalene, here portrayed as a wild courtesan, entertain many men around her. Upon learning that Judas is with a carpenter she rides out on her chariot drawn by zebras to get him back. Peter is introduced as the Giant apostle, and we see the future gospel writer Mark as a child who is healed by Jesus. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is shown as a beautiful and saintly woman who is a mother to all her son's followers. Our first sight of Jesus is through the eyesight of a little girl, whom he heals. He is surrounded by a halo. Mary Magdelene arrives afterwards and talks to Judas, who reveals that he is only staying with Jesus in hopes of being made a high official after Jesus becomes the king of kings. Jesus casts the Seven Deadly Sins out of Mary Magdalene in a multiple exposure sequence.
Jesus is also shown resurrecting Lazarus and healing the little children. Some humor is derived when one girl asks if he can heal broken legs, and, when he says yes, she gives him a legless doll. Jesus smiles and repairs the doll. The crucifixion is foreshadowed when Jesus, having helped a poor family, wanders through the father's carpentry shop, and, himself a carpenter's son, he briefly helps carve a piece of wood. When a sheet covering the object is removed, it is revealed to be a cross towering over Jesus.
Jesus and his apostles enter Jerusalem, where Judas incites the people and rallies them to proclaim Jesus King of the Jews. Jesus, however, renounces all claims of being an Earthly king. Caiaphas the High Priest is also angry at Judas for having led people to a man whom he sees as a false prophet. Meanwhile, Jesus drives away Satan, who had offered him an Earthly kingdom, and he protects a woman caught in adultery. The words he draws in the sand are revealed to be the sins the accusers themselves committed.
Judas, desperate to save himself from Caiaphas, agrees to turn over Jesus. Noticeably at the Last Supper, when Jesus distributes the bread and wine saying that they are his body and blood, Judas refuses to eat. Judas puts the cup to his lips but refuses to drink; he tears off a piece of bread but lets it drop to the ground. Towards the end, Mary confronts her son and tells him to flee from the danger that is coming. Jesus replies that it must be done for the salvation of all peoples. They leave the room but the camera focuses on the table upon which a dove alights for a moment.
Jesus goes to the Garden of Gethsemane where he is soon captured by the Roman soldiers and betrayed by Judas. Judas' life is saved, but, upon seeing that Jesus is going to be killed as a result, he is horrified. Judas takes a rope that the Romans had used to bind Jesus' wrists and runs off. Jesus is beaten and then presented by Pontius Pilate to the crowd. Mary pleads for the life of her son and Mary Magdalene speaks for him but Caiaphas bribes the crowd to shout against Jesus.
Jesus is taken away to be crucified, though he pauses on the Via Dolorosa to heal a group of cripples in an alley, despite his weakened condition. Jesus is crucified and his enemies throw insults at him. (One woman even anachronistically eats popcorn and smiles with glee at Jesus' crucifixion.) When Jesus does die, however, a great earthquake comes up. The tree where Judas had hanged himself, with the rope used to bind Jesus's wrists, is swallowed up amidst gouts of hellfire. The sky turns black, lightning strikes, the wind blows, the people who had mocked Jesus run in terror, and the veil covering the Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple is torn in two.
The tumult ends when Mary looks up at heaven and asks God to forgive the world for the death of their son. The chaos ends and the Sun shines. Jesus is taken down from the cross and is buried. On the third day, he rises from the dead as promised. To emphasize the importance of the resurrection, this scene from an otherwise black and white film is shot in color. Jesus goes to the Apostles and tells them to spread his message to the world. He tells them ""I am with you always"" as the scene shifts to a modern city to show that Jesus still watches over his followers.

1927,London After Midnight,American,Tod Browning,"Lon Chaney, Marceline Day, Conrad Nagel",thriller,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_After_Midnight_(film),"In a cultured and peaceful home on the outskirts of London,[9] the head of the household, Sir Roger Balfour, is found dead from what initially appears to be a self-inflicted bullet wound, despite the insistence of Balfour's friend and neighbour, Sir James Hamlin, that his old friend would never have taken his own life. Nonetheless, Balfour's death is officially declared a suicide by Inspector Edward C. Burke of Scotland Yard.[9][10][11]
Five years later, with the case still unresolved, a sinister-looking man with pointed teeth wearing a Beaver-skin top hat, arrives at the household accompanied by a cadaverous-looking woman in a long gown; the arrival of these two individuals prompts Sir James Hamlin, the friend and neighbour of the late Roger Balfour, to call Scotland Yard. This in turn prompts Inspector Burke to travel to the household, where he discovers that three individuals now present in the household had been the only three who had been present five years previously when Roger Balfour had died. Initially, Burke remains sceptical that any of these three individuals (Balfour's daughter, Lucille, his butler Williams, and Arthur Hibbs,[12] the nephew/secretary of the neighbour who had placed the call to Scotland Yard) may have been involved in his murder, until Balfour's body disappears from its tomb and an individual looking distinctly like him is seen around the old Balfour estate. This, in addition to other eerie acts such as instances of singular gunshots being heard in Roger Balfour's former bedroom occurring in the household while Burke is there and the sinister-looking Man in the Beaver Hat repeatedly terrifying those within the household, prompts him to determine to identify Balfour's killer by reproducing the former crime scene and using hypnosis to induce the culprit into re-enacting the murder.[10][11][13][13][13][13]",cultur peac home outskirt london9 head household sir roger balfour found dead initi appear selfinflict bullet wound despit insist balfour friend neighbour sir jame hamlin old friend would never taken life nonetheless balfour death offici declar suicid inspector edward c burk scotland yard91011 five year later case still unresolv sinisterlook man point teeth wear beaverskin top hat arriv household accompani cadaverouslook woman long gown arriv two individu prompt sir jame hamlin friend neighbour late roger balfour call scotland yard turn prompt inspector burk travel household discov three individu present household three present five year previous roger balfour die initi burk remain sceptic three individu balfour daughter lucil butler william arthur hibbs12 nephewsecretari neighbour place call scotland yard may involv murder balfour bodi disappear tomb individu look distinctli like seen around old balfour estat addit eeri act instanc singular gunshot heard roger balfour former bedroom occur household burk sinisterlook man beaver hat repeatedli terrifi within household prompt determin identifi balfour killer reproduc former crime scene use hypnosi induc culprit reenact murder101113131313

1927,My Best Girl,American,Sam Taylor,"Mary Pickford, Buddy Rogers",romantic comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Best_Girl_(1927_film),"The film starts out at The Merrill Department store where a very exhausted stockgirl named Maggie Johnson (Mary Pickford) is given a moment to attend to the sales counter. There she encounters a charming handsome man who pretends to be interested in purchasing some children's toys but, after many humorous demonstrations by Maggie, the manager comes over and gives the man his time card. The man is said to be Joe Grant (Buddy Rogers) though in reality he is the son of the owner; making him Joseph Merrill. To prove to his father he is ready for his engagement, he has taken the job of stockboy under an assumed name.
Annoyed, Maggie takes Joe back to the stockroom and tells him to get to work. He is so inept that she calls him, 'The Dumbest Stockboy in the World' though she promises to take him under her wing, much to his amusement.
A few days later, after her shift, Maggie is outside waiting for Joe. She appears to have a crush on him. Some of her coworkers tease her but eventually warn her that Joe is coming, causing Maggie to hop on her ride home from work: the back of an open truck. Joe is swarmed with salesgirls who try for his attention causing him to not focus on Maggie. Determined Maggie throws her bag on the ground as the vehicle pulls away. Joe picks it up and chases the truck down to give it to her. After three more times of this, he finally grows weary and jumps in the truck to join Maggie, who feigns innocence.
The two flirt and Maggie shows him pictures of her off-kilter family. Once they reach her home, she invites him in for supper only to find her family is causing a commotion. Her father (Lucien Littlefield) is an elderly postal worker who is meek and easily subdued. Her mother (Sunshine Hart) is a dramatic woman who enjoys going to random funerals and makes frequent use of smelling salts to avoid fainting. Her sister Liz (Carmelita Geraghty) is a flapper who has a boyfriend who gets her into trouble. Maggie does her best to hide the goings on but eventually caves and sends Joe on his way hoping to have dinner with him another day.
Time passes and Joe's mother is planning his engagement announcement party. However she has not mentioned it to him, hoping to make it a surprise. Joe has been promoted and is now Maggie's boss. However, he still eats lunch with her every day in the stockroom. During one such lunch, after receiving the note to join his parents for dinner (for the surprise party), Maggie gives him a watch for his birthday. He is touched and puts it on. Shortly after this he accidentally catches his sleeve on a nail. Trying to pull himself free, he accidentally puts his arm around Maggie, and after the mutual surprise the two kiss.
Enamored with each other they head out on the town to walk in the rain. Joe begins to spend money and she tells him he'll end up in the poorhouse. Joe offers to buy her dinner at a nice restaurant but, embarrassed by her shoddy work clothes, Maggie declines. Joe gets the idea to tell her they should follow the store's company motto, ""We're all a family"" and that, if they were family, they could eat at the Merrill Mansion. Maggie, thinking he is joking, agrees. Meanwhile, her sister is arrested because of her association with her boyfriend, and is taken to night court. Her family frets at not being able to find Maggie, who they believe needs to help Liz out of the mess. Maggie had tried to call them, but after a few rings (while her father made his way to the phone) she hung up.
Arriving at the Merrill Mansion, Maggie is amazed that it is the real deal. Joe is amused with her reluctance but eventually gets her into the mansion, much to the butler's amusement. Maggie is extremely reluctant until Joe convinces the butler to say 'a Merrill employee eats here almost every night!' Maggie relaxes and tells Joe they should pretend to be Mr. and Mrs. Merrill. Joe is extremely amused by this, and at her lack of formal dinner habits.
At the surprise engagement party, Joe's family sits concerned. They return home to find Joe and Maggie, who has hidden under the table. Joe admits he is 'Joseph Merrill' but before he can explain further his fiancee (Avonne Taylor) arrives and kisses him in front of Maggie. Maggie, heartbroken leaves. Joe, upset, tells his fiancee he had broken Maggie's heart and must go after her.
Maggie walks and walks until she returns to where Joe and her shared a moment which happens to be by the night court. She sees her family arrive and after they chasten her they enter the court to try to save Liz from prison. Meanwhile Joe arrives at the same spot only to be helped by a homeless man who had watched their interactions. Joe enters the court to hear Maggie's passionate plea for her sister, whom the judge eventually lets go.
While Maggie fetches water for her 'on the verge of fainting' mother, Joe walks over to Maggie and apologizes, saying he did not love his fiancee and would not marry her. He then proposes to Maggie which causes (for a change) her sister to faint. While everyone tries to revive Liz, Liz's boyfriend makes a remark to her father about Maggie 'taking up with the Merrill boy' implying that it was only for sex. Joe, offended, punches him and begins to fight in the courtroom.
The next day, Maggie is back home, reading the paper which has headlines about their romance. Joe's father (Hobart Bosworth) arrives at the home. He tells Maggie he wants to send his son to Hawaii until the scandal blew over, which Joe agreed to. However, Joe apparently made plans to bring Maggie as well and marry on the boat. Mr. Merrill, not happy with this, tries to buy Maggie off with a check for $10,000 just as Joe arrives, unaware his father is there. Joe tells Maggie his plans and she becomes upset. Angry, she begins a whole tirade against him trying to find out if he really loved her or not. She begins to claim she is just a jazz girl and knew who he was all along. That she was a gold digger and just after his money and, thanks to his father, she now had what she wanted. She even plays a jazz record and puts on lipstick in an attempt to prove her point.
Joe begins to cry, and Maggie, touched, breaks down and admits that none of it is true and the real reason she cannot go away with him is because of her family (who had been listening in the living room the whole time) who needs her more than he does. Her father becomes livid and declares it was time 'he became the father of the family' and takes charge of his wife and daughters. In a comedic scene he commands everyone (including both Merrills) to pack Maggie's things for the ship which leaves in ten minutes.

1927,The Red Mill,American,Fatty Arbuckle,"Marion Davies, Owen Moore",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Mill_(film),"Tina (Marion Davies) is the drudge of the Red Mill Tavern in Holland. She works hard and long hours, with her only company being a mouse, named Ignatz. Willem (George Siegmann) is the mean Tavern proprietor who catches her feeding the mouse. He is outraged and scares away the mouse and takes it out on Tina.
Dennis Wheat (Owen Moore) is a foreigner who came to the Netherlands for the damsels. He was accompanied by his valet Caesar Rinkle (Snitz Edwards). One day, Tina notices and immediately falls in love with him. She sneaks out of the tavern to be closer to him and hears him saying he will judge an ice skating race. The winner of the race will be kissed by him.
Tina decides to enter and wins. When Dennis is about to kiss her, Willem storms out and takes Tina with him. She later finds out Dennis is leaving town and becomes sad. Tina goes back to her hard working days and fantasizes about Dennis returning. Dennis returns in the spring and takes an interest in the Burgomaster's daughter Gretchen (Louise Fazenda), who is about to marry the Governor (William Orlamond) but actually is in love with Captain Jacop Van Goop (Karl Dane).
Jacop sends Gretchen a letter, begging her to elope with him at night. Gretchen has to cross her overprotecting father if she wants to leave the house, and does not think there is any chance she will be able to leave the house. Tina, however, helps her escape successfully by dressing up like her and Gretchen dressing up like Tina. After Gretchen has left, Dennis sneaks into the house to meet the woman he noticed. He kisses Tina, thinking it is Gretchen.
Gretchen goes back home when she is scared after Tina's mouse ran into her shoe. Meanwhile, Caesar overhears someone saying Gretchen will inherit her grandfather's estate the day she marries and immediately informs Dennis. Jacop climbs on a ladder leading to Gretchen's room to reunite with her. Dennis sees this and thinks Jacop is kissing the same girl he kissed. He is mad and throws a stone to him, making him fall off his ladder through the window of the tavern.
Tina comes up, still dressed up as Gretchen, and tells Dennis Jacop was a relative and it was only a formal kiss. She promises to elope with him in the morning. The next day, Gretchen is forced to marry the governor. She begs Tina to save her, before she leaves with her father. Tina eventually scares everyone away with her mouse, and sneaks off with Gretchen. Gretchen is soon reunited with Jacop, but Tina is left being chased by both the wedding guests and the burgomaster.
Willem finds her hiding in the tavern and locks her up in a mill, which is rumored to be haunted by ghosts. Tina is scared, but Dennis comes after her and protects himself with a gun. An accident causes him to shoot Tina in the back. They kiss and are happy, but find out Willem is after them with a shotgun.

1927,The Scar of Shame,American,The Scar of Shame,Harry Henderson and Lucia Lynn Moses,race film,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scar_of_Shame,"While practicing piano, Alvin sees Louise being beaten by Spike, and he rescues her and then brings her back to Lucretia’s house. Lucretia, the owner of the boarding house where Alvin is residing, allows Louise to stay in return for chores around the house. Eddie meets with Spike, who has a black eye after the incident, and the former attempts to convince Spike to let Louise work as an entertainer for him. Spike doesn’t seem enthusiastic and shows regret for beating her, which he later credits to his alcoholism. Spike has some desire to allow his daughter to escape the kind of life he is stuck in, but he is unable to change any of his actions without being sucked into his old lifestyle by the alcohol supplied by Eddie.
Eddie learns the truth about the confrontation between Alvin and Spike during dinner at Lucretia’s. Later in the evening, Eddie forcefully attempts to bring Louise back to her “old pappy” but again Alvin intervenes. Drunk again from Eddie’s liquor, Spike continues to harass Louise who contemplates suicide if it continues. Alvin proposes to Louise after rescuing her again from the altercation, claiming that she wouldn’t need to worry about harm if they were married. After he defends Louise from Eddie at Lucretia’s house, Alvin exclaims, “I’ll teach you to treat our women like that!”
Over more alcohol, Eddie schemes with Spike to distract Alvin with a fake telegram announcing his mother’s illness while they kidnap Louise. Alvin cannot take Louise with him because he hasn’t informed his mother of their marriage, which she would not have approved of because of her concern with class. Louise laments in life and finds a letter from Alvin’s mother urging him to marry another woman who is “part of our set,” referring to the same level in social stratification. She proceeds to rip the letter and then the marriage certificate.
Before they go through with the plan, Spike once again hesitates, remarking that she is better off away from people like him. Alvin comes back to confront Eddie after learning he had been tricked, and that his mother was visiting friends out of town. The scene is cut between Alvin's being in the car in the suburbs and Louise's tearing up mementos of their marriage. Eddie breaks into the house and entices Louise with far-fetched possibilities of becoming rich. As Alvin enters and guns are pulled, someone accidentally shoots Louise in the neck leaving a scar. Louise becomes involved with Eddie's gambling while Alvin is in prison. Eddie refers to Alvin as a “dicty sap” which insults his ambitions to move up the rungs of the class system.
Alvin escapes prison by filing the bars in his cell and re-establishes himself as a music instructor with a false name. Alvin falls in love with his student, Alice, but “lives a daily lie” because he has hidden the secrets of his past. Louise is involved with Alice’s father so Alvin meets her after dropping an urgent note to Alice’s father. Alice’s father unknowingly pairs the two together for a dance. Later that night, Louise makes advances on Alvin, threatening to expose him, and he gives in for a moment but in a later scene Alvin rejects her and leaves. In distress, Louise kills herself after writing a revealing letter of repentance and apology. In it she confesses that it was really Eddie who shot her neck, and he wouldn’t allow her to tell the truth during the trial.
Alvin feels compelled to inform Alice and her family about his secrets after hearing of Louise’s death, and they forgive him. The lament of Alice’s father mirrors the earlier foreword in blaming the environment and Louise’s lack of education, finishing with the statement: “our people have much to learn.”",practic piano alvin see louis beaten spike rescu bring back lucretia ’ hous lucretia owner board hous alvin resid allow louis stay return chore around hous eddi meet spike black eye incid former attempt convinc spike let louis work entertain spike ’ seem enthusiast show regret beat later credit alcohol spike desir allow daughter escap kind life stuck unabl chang action without suck old lifestyl alcohol suppli eddi eddi learn truth confront alvin spike dinner lucretia ’ later even eddi forc attempt bring louis back “ old pappi ” alvin interven drunk eddi ’ liquor spike continu harass louis contempl suicid continu alvin propos louis rescu alterc claim ’ need worri harm marri defend louis eddi lucretia ’ hous alvin exclaim “ ’ teach treat women like ” alcohol eddi scheme spike distract alvin fake telegram announc mother ’ ill kidnap louis alvin take louis ’ inform mother marriag would approv concern class louis lament life find letter alvin ’ mother urg marri anoth woman “ part set ” refer level social stratif proce rip letter marriag certif go plan spike hesit remark better away peopl like alvin come back confront eddi learn trick mother visit friend town scene cut alvin car suburb louis tear memento marriag eddi break hous entic louis farfetch possibl becom rich alvin enter gun pull someon accident shoot louis neck leav scar louis becom involv eddi gambl alvin prison eddi refer alvin “ dicti sap ” insult ambit move rung class system alvin escap prison file bar cell reestablish music instructor fals name alvin fall love student alic “ live daili lie ” hidden secret past louis involv alic ’ father alvin meet drop urgent note alic ’ father alic ’ father unknowingli pair two togeth danc later night louis make advanc alvin threaten expos give moment later scene alvin reject leav distress louis kill write reveal letter repent apolog confess realli eddi shot neck ’ allow tell truth trial alvin feel compel inform alic famili secret hear louis ’ death forgiv lament alic ’ father mirror earlier foreword blame environ louis ’ lack educ finish statement “ peopl much learn ”
1927,The Show,American,Tod Browning,"John Gilbert, Renee Adoree, Lionel Barrymore",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Show_(1927_film),"Cock Robin (John Gilbert) is a sideshow barker in Budapest. He also participates in one of the acts; his former girlfriend Salome (Renée Adorée) dances before Herod in exchange for the head of ""Jokanaan"". As Jokanaan, Robin has his head seemingly chopped off and presented to the dancer on a platter, much to the delight of the audience.
Salome wants to get back together with Robin, but he has his sights set on Lena (Gertrude Short), the daughter of a well-off sheep merchant. He lets the smitten Lena buy him things. The Greek (Lionel Barrymore), Salome's current boyfriend, becomes angered when he learns of her feelings. The Greek and his henchman, the Ferret, also try to steal Lena's father's money, but fail to find it after they murder him.
That night, a heartbroken Lena tells Robin that her father has been killed. She trustingly shows him the substantial amount of money she had been holding for her father; when Robin ascertains that she has no brothers and that she has many more sheep, he becomes very interested. However, Salome eavesdrops, bursts in and warns Lena that Robin is only after her for her wealth. Lena flees, without her money. Robin is furious and can barely restrain himself from beating Salome.
When Lena shows up at the sideshow with a policeman, Salome has Robin hide in her attic. One day, an old blind man (Edward Connelly), another resident of the building, comes to Salome to have her read to him another letter from his son; Salome tells him that the man has been promoted to captain and received a decoration. She assures the old man that his son will return someday with his regiment. Later, however, she reveals to Robin that the son is actually in the prison across the street, scheduled to be hanged the next morning. That morning, the old man hears voices in Salome's room and assumes his son has finally come home. Bursting with joy, he mistakes Robin for his son and takes him to his room, where he puts on his old uniform. Then, just after his real son is executed, he passes away.
The Greek first tries to rid himself of his romantic rival by taking the place of the ""executioner"" and using a real sword to lop of Robin's head, but Salome sees through his disguise and stops him. When Robin goes into hiding, the Greek steals another sideshow attraction, a poisonous lizard, and plants it in Salome's attic.
An official calls on Salome to inform her that she can claim her brother's possessions at the prison; Robin then realizes that the old man was her father. Thoroughly ashamed of himself, Robin reconciles with her. However, the official had spotted him hiding behind the door. When a policeman comes to arrest him, Robin hides in the attic, where the Greek has also been trapped. In the ensuing scuffle, the Greek is bitten by the lizard. Robin takes the money from his dead body and gives it to the policeman. For returning it voluntarily, Robin is let off. He and Salome return to the sideshow. When next they perform the act, she kisses him while his head is on the platter.",cock robin john gilbert sideshow barker budapest also particip one act former girlfriend salom rené adoré danc herod exchang head jokanaan jokanaan robin head seemingli chop present dancer platter much delight audienc salom want get back togeth robin sight set lena gertrud short daughter welloff sheep merchant let smitten lena buy thing greek lionel barrymor salom current boyfriend becom anger learn feel greek henchman ferret also tri steal lena father money fail find murder night heartbroken lena tell robin father kill trustingli show substanti amount money hold father robin ascertain brother mani sheep becom interest howev salom eavesdrop burst warn lena robin wealth lena flee without money robin furiou bare restrain beat salom lena show sideshow policeman salom robin hide attic one day old blind man edward connelli anoth resid build come salom read anoth letter son salom tell man promot captain receiv decor assur old man son return someday regiment later howev reveal robin son actual prison across street schedul hang next morn morn old man hear voic salom room assum son final come home burst joy mistak robin son take room put old uniform real son execut pass away greek first tri rid romant rival take place execution use real sword lop robin head salom see disguis stop robin goe hide greek steal anoth sideshow attract poison lizard plant salom attic offici call salom inform claim brother possess prison robin realiz old man father thoroughli asham robin reconcil howev offici spot hide behind door policeman come arrest robin hide attic greek also trap ensu scuffl greek bitten lizard robin take money dead bodi give policeman return voluntarili robin let salom return sideshow next perform act kiss head platter

He later that day announces to his dad he is invited by The Oakmont Country Club to be a guest of the club for a minimum of two weeks. His role there will be the teacher of Mr. Waters, trying to teach him how to golf. Pop doesn't want to say goodbye, but lets him go.

The next day, Jack sets a record with the golf tournament. While giving his victory speech, he notices his father, who came there to tell his son how proud he is of him. Jack realizes his club membership is almost over and swears he will marry a rich girl, which would make him allowed to stay at the club. He decides to propose to Allie, but she informs him her father has just lost all of his money. She admits she now has to marry a wealthy man to keep her social position.
They are interrupted by Martha Lomsdom (Eileen Percy), who invites them to a party. On their way, Jack sees Allie is flirting with Johnson, so he does the same with the wealthy Martha.

1927,The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg,American,Ernst Lubitsch,Ramon Novarro and Norma Shearer,romantic comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Student_Prince_in_Old_Heidelberg,"Young Crown Prince Karl Heinrich (Philippe De Lacy), heir to the kingdom of Karlsburg, is brought to live with his stern uncle, King Karl VII (Gustav von Seyffertitz). The king immediately dismisses the boy's nanny (Edythe Chapman) without telling the youngster to avoid an emotional farewell. Fortunately, Dr. Friedrich Jüttner (Jean Hersholt), his new tutor, proves to be sympathetic, and they become lifelong friends. Nonetheless, despite the commoners' belief that it must be wonderful to be him, the boy grows up lonely, without playmates his own age.
Upon passing his high school examination in 1901 with the help of Dr.Jüttner, the young prince (Ramón Novarro) is delighted to learn that both he and Jüttner are being sent to Heidelberg, where he will continue his education. When they arrive, Karl's servant is appalled at the rooms provided for the prince and Jüttner at the inn of Ruder (Otis Harlan). When Ruder's niece Kathi (Norma Shearer) stoutly defends the centuries-old family business, Karl is entranced by her, and decides to stay. He is quickly made a member of Corps Saxonia, a student society.
Later that day, Karl tries to kiss Kathi, only to learn that she is engaged. Her family approves of her fiance, but she is not so sure about him. She eventually confesses to Karl that, despite the vast social gulf between them, she has fallen in love with him. Karl feels the same about her and swears that he will let nothing separate them. When he takes her boating, their rower, Johann Kellermann, turns his back to them to give them some privacy. Karl jokingly tells him that, when he is king, he will make Kellermann his majordomo.
Then Jüttner receives a letter from the king ordering him to inform Karl that he has selected a princess for him to marry. Jüttner cannot bring himself to destroy his friend's happiness. That same day, however, Prime Minister von Haugk (Edward Connelly) arrives with the news that the king is seriously ill, and that Karl must go home and take up the reins of government. When Karl sees his uncle, he is told of the matrimonial plans. While Karl is still reeling from the shock, the old king dies, followed by Jüttner.
Later, von Haugk presses the new monarch about the marriage. The anguished Karl signs the document for the wedding. Then Kellermann shows up to take the job Karl had offered him. When Karl asks him about Kathi, he learns that she is still waiting for him. He goes to see her one last time.
In the last scene, Karl is shown riding through the streets in a carriage with his bride.

1927,Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,American,F. W. Murnau,George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor,melodrama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise:_A_Song_of_Two_Humans,"A vacationing Woman from the City (Margaret Livingston) lingers in a lakeside town for weeks. After dark, she goes to a farmhouse where the Man (George O'Brien) and the Wife (Janet Gaynor) live with their child. She whistles from the fence outside. The Man is torn, but finally departs, leaving his wife with the memories of better times when they were deeply in love.
The man and woman meet in the moonlight and kiss passionately. She wants him to sell his farm—which has not done well recently—to join her in the city. When she suggests that he solve the problem of his wife by drowning her, he throttles her violently, but even that dissolves in a passionate embrace. The Woman gathers bundles of reeds so that when the boat is overturned, the Man can stay afloat.
The Wife suspects nothing when her husband suggests going on an outing, but when they set off across the lake, she soon grows suspicious. He prepares to throw her overboard, but when she pleads for his mercy, he realizes he cannot do it. He rows frantically for shore, and when the boat reaches land, the Wife flees.
She boards a trolley, and he follows, begging her not to be afraid of him. The trolley brings them to the city. Her fear and disappointment are overwhelming. He plies her with flowers and cakes and finally she stops crying and accepts his gifts. Emerging back on the street, they are touched to see a bride enter a church for her processional, and follow her inside to watch the wedding. The Man breaks down and asks her to forgive him. After a tearful reconciliation, they continue their adventure in the city, having their photograph taken together and visiting a funfair. As darkness falls, they board the trolley for home.
Soon they are drifting back across the lake under the moonlight. A sudden storm causes their boat to begin sinking. The Man remembers the two bundles of reeds he placed in the boat earlier and ties the bundles around the Wife. The boat capsizes, and the Man awakes on a rocky shore. He gathers the townspeople to search the lake, but all they find is a broken bundle of reeds floating in the water.
Convinced the Wife has drowned, the grief-stricken Man stumbles home. The Woman From the City goes to his house, assuming their plan has succeeded. The Man begins to choke her. Then the Maid calls to him that his wife is alive, so he releases the Woman and runs to the Wife, who survived by clinging to one last bundle of reeds.
The Man kneels by the Wife's bed as she slowly opens her eyes. The Man and the Wife kiss, while the Woman From the City's carriage rolls down the hill toward the lake, and the film dissolves to the sunrise.",vacat woman citi margaret livingston linger lakesid town week dark goe farmhous man georg obrien wife janet gaynor live child whistl fenc outsid man torn final depart leav wife memori better time deepli love man woman meet moonlight kiss passion want sell farm—which done well recently—to join citi suggest solv problem wife drown throttl violent even dissolv passion embrac woman gather bundl reed boat overturn man stay afloat wife suspect noth husband suggest go outing set across lake soon grow suspici prepar throw overboard plead merci realiz row frantic shore boat reach land wife flee board trolley follow beg afraid trolley bring citi fear disappoint overwhelm pli flower cake final stop cri accept gift emerg back street touch see bride enter church procession follow insid watch wed man break ask forgiv tear reconcili continu adventur citi photograph taken togeth visit funfair dark fall board trolley home soon drift back across lake moonlight sudden storm caus boat begin sink man rememb two bundl reed place boat earlier tie bundl around wife boat capsiz man awak rocki shore gather townspeopl search lake find broken bundl reed float water convinc wife drown griefstricken man stumbl home woman citi goe hous assum plan succeed man begin choke maid call wife aliv releas woman run wife surviv cling one last bundl reed man kneel wife bed slowli open eye man wife kiss woman citi carriag roll hill toward lake film dissolv sunris
1927,Two Arabian Knights,American,Lewis Milestone,"William Boyd, Mary Astor, Louis Wolheim, Ian Keith",comedy adventure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Arabian_Knights,"During the First World War, two American soldiers become trapped in no man's land. Expecting to die, W. Dangerfield Phelps III (William Boyd) decides to fulfill his fondest desire: to beat up his sergeant since training camp, Peter O'Gaffney (Louis Wolheim). While they are brawling, the Germans sneak up and capture them.
In a German prison camp, the two become friends when Phelps takes responsibility for an unflattering caricature he drew of a guard, rather than let O'Gaffney take the blame. The two escape, stealing the white robes of Arab prisoners to blend in with the snow. However, they encounter (and are forced to join) a group of similarly garbed Arab prisoners being sent by train to Constantinople.
Near the end of their journey, Phelps creates a distraction, and the two men jump off, landing in a hay wagon. When the hay is loaded onto a ship bound for Arabia, so are they. The stowaways are discovered, but the skipper (Michael Visaroff) is satisfied when Phelps pays him their fare.
When a small boat founders nearby, Phelps jumps in to try to rescue an Arabian woman, Mirza (Mary Astor). Both he and the woman have to be saved by O'Gaffney. The two soldiers and the skipper vie for the veiled woman's affections. Phelps eventually coaxes her into removing her veil, and is entranced by her beauty. Meanwhile, the woman's escort observes this development with disapproval. The skipper insists on being paid for Mirza's fare, but none of the three have any money left. They hold him off as best they can.
When they reach their destination, the skipper refuses to let Mirza debark without paying, so O'Gaffney robs the purser (Boris Karloff) to get the money. Mirza is met by Shevket Ben Ali (Ian Keith); Mirza informs Phelps that her father has arranged for her to marry Shevket. They depart. The Americans jump overboard when the skipper discovers what happened to his purser.
The two men head for the American consul, but leave hastily without speaking to him when they find the skipper already there lodging a complaint. They decide to seek the assistance of Mirza's father the Emir, who turns out to be the governor of the region. However, Mirza's escort has told him and Shevket that Phelps has seen her without her veil. Outraged, the Emir sends his men to bring the Americans back to be executed. Unaware of this, the two soldiers saunter into the Emir's palace. Fortunately, Phelps reads Mirza's warning note in time, and the two escape.
When Phelps sets out to rescue Mirza, O'Gaffney shows true friendship and accompanies him. They are trapped by Shevket and his men, but when Mirza threatens to kill herself, Shevket proposes they settle this with a duel in which only one of the pistols is loaded. Phelps agrees and fires first; his gun is the unloaded one. Mirza is made to leave the room. Then Shevket reveals that both guns are empty; he did not wish to wager his life with a ""dog"". He exits, leaving his men to dispose of Phelps. The two men overcome their captors, relieve Shevket of Mirza, and ride away.",first world war two american soldier becom trap man land expect die w dangerfield phelp iii william boyd decid fulfil fondest desir beat sergeant sinc train camp peter ogaffney loui wolheim brawl german sneak captur german prison camp two becom friend phelp take respons unflatt caricatur drew guard rather let ogaffney take blame two escap steal white robe arab prison blend snow howev encount forc join group similarli garb arab prison sent train constantinopl near end journey phelp creat distract two men jump land hay wagon hay load onto ship bound arabia stowaway discov skipper michael visaroff satisfi phelp pay fare small boat founder nearbi phelp jump tri rescu arabian woman mirza mari astor woman save ogaffney two soldier skipper vie veil woman affect phelp eventu coax remov veil entranc beauti meanwhil woman escort observ develop disapprov skipper insist paid mirza fare none three money left hold best reach destin skipper refus let mirza debark without pay ogaffney rob purser bori karloff get money mirza met shevket ben ali ian keith mirza inform phelp father arrang marri shevket depart american jump overboard skipper discov happen purser two men head american consul leav hastili without speak find skipper alreadi lodg complaint decid seek assist mirza father emir turn governor region howev mirza escort told shevket phelp seen without veil outrag emir send men bring american back execut unawar two soldier saunter emir palac fortun phelp read mirza warn note time two escap phelp set rescu mirza ogaffney show true friendship accompani trap shevket men mirza threaten kill shevket propos settl duel one pistol load phelp agre fire first gun unload one mirza made leav room shevket reveal gun empti wish wager life dog exit leav men dispos phelp two men overcom captor reliev shevket mirza ride away

1927,The Unknown,American,Tod Browning,"Lon Chaney, Joan Crawford",horror,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unknown_(1927_film),"Alonzo the Armless is a circus freak who uses his feet to toss knives and fire a rifle at his partner, Nanon. However, he is an impostor and fugitive. He has arms, but keeps them tightly bound to his torso, a secret known only to his friend Cojo, a midget. Alonzo's left hand has a double thumb, which would identify him as the perpetrator of various crimes.
Alonzo is secretly in love with Nanon. Malabar, the circus strongman, is devoted to her as well, but she has a strong fear of men's arms and cannot stand being pawed by them, so she shuns him. She only feels comfortable around the armless Alonzo. When she embraces and kisses him, he is given hope, but Cojo warns him that he cannot let it happen again. If she holds him, she might feel his arms.
When Antonio Zanzi, the circus's owner and Nanon's father, discovers Alonzo's secret, Alonzo kills him with his bare hands. Nanon witnesses this through a window. A flash of lightning reveals that her father's killer has a double thumb on his left hand, but she does not see his face. Since Alonzo is believed to be armless, he is not a suspect.
When the circus leaves town, Alonzo has Nanon remain behind with him. He takes extreme measures to try to have the woman he loves. He blackmails a surgeon into amputating his arms. While he is away, however, Malabar's steadfast love finally enables Nanon to overcome her phobia, and she agrees to marry him.
When Alonzo (now truly armless) returns to Nanon, she excitedly tells him the news. Alonzo is shocked and horrified, first laughing, then crying, confusing the couple. He then learns that Malabar and Nanon have been practicing a new act, where the strongman's arms are seemingly pulled in opposite directions by two horses (who are actually on hidden treadmills). During the first performance, Alonzo stops one treadmill in an attempt to maim or kill his rival. When Nanon starts to intervene, Alonzo threatens her with a knife. However, she rushes to calm down one of the horses. Alonzo tries to save her from injury by pushing her out of the way. The horse knocks Alonzo down and fatally stomps on him.
In the original film script and some discarded filmed sequences, Alonzo murders both the doctor and Cojo, to eliminate them as witnesses before he returns to claim Nanon.",alonzo armless circu freak use feet toss knive fire rifl partner nanon howev impostor fugit arm keep tightli bound torso secret known friend cojo midget alonzo left hand doubl thumb would identifi perpetr variou crime alonzo secretli love nanon malabar circu strongman devot well strong fear men arm stand paw shun feel comfort around armless alonzo embrac kiss given hope cojo warn let happen hold might feel arm antonio zanzi circuss owner nanon father discov alonzo secret alonzo kill bare hand nanon wit window flash lightn reveal father killer doubl thumb left hand see face sinc alonzo believ armless suspect circu leav town alonzo nanon remain behind take extrem measur tri woman love blackmail surgeon amput arm away howev malabar steadfast love final enabl nanon overcom phobia agre marri alonzo truli armless return nanon excitedli tell news alonzo shock horrifi first laugh cri confus coupl learn malabar nanon practic new act strongman arm seemingli pull opposit direct two hors actual hidden treadmil first perform alonzo stop one treadmil attempt maim kill rival nanon start interven alonzo threaten knife howev rush calm one hors alonzo tri save injuri push way hors knock alonzo fatal stomp origin film script discard film sequenc alonzo murder doctor cojo elimin wit return claim nanon
1927,The Way of All Flesh,American,Victor Fleming,"Emil Jannings, Belle Bennett, Phyllis Haver",melodrama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_All_Flesh_(1927_film),"In the story, which opens in the early 1900s, Jannings plays August Schiller, a bank clerk in Milwaukee who is happy with both his job and his family. But when bank officials ask him to transport $1,000 in securities to Chicago, he meets a blond seductress on the train, who sees what he is carrying. She flirts with him, convinces him to buy her a bottle of champagne, and takes him to a saloon run by a crook. The next morning he awakes alone in a dilapidated bedroom, without the securities. He finds the woman, and at first pleads with her, then intimidates her to return the stolen securities. He is knocked unconscious by the saloon owner and dragged to a nearby railroad track.
As the crook strips him of everything that might lead to his identification, Schiller recovers consciousness, and in a struggle the crook is thrown into the path of an oncoming train and killed. Schiller flees, and in despair is about to take his own life, when he sees in a newspaper that he is supposedly dead, the crook's mangled body having been identified as Schiller's. The time passes to twenty years later. Schiller is aged and unkempt, employed to pick up trash in a park. He sees his own family go to a cemetery and place a wreath on his grave. Following other scenes in a Christmas snowstorm, Schiller makes his way to his former home, where he sees that the son whom he had taught to play violin is now a successful musician. He walks away, carrying in his pocket a dollar that his son has given him, not recognizing that the old tramp is his father.

Jack fails to realize that ""the girl next door"", Mary Preston, is desperately in love with him. The two young men both enlist to become combat pilots in the Air Service. When they leave for training camp, Jack mistakenly believes Sylvia prefers him. She actually prefers David and lets him know about her feelings, but is too kindhearted to turn down Jack's affection.
Jack and David are billeted together. Their tent mate is Cadet White, but their acquaintance is all too brief; White is killed in an air crash the same day. Undaunted, the two men endure a rigorous training period, where they go from being enemies to best friends. Upon graduating, they are shipped off to France to fight the Germans.
Mary joins the war effort by becoming an ambulance driver. She later learns of Jack's reputation as the ace known as ""The Shooting Star"" and encounters him while on leave in Paris. She finds him, but he is too drunk to recognize her. She puts him to bed, but when two military police barge in while she is innocently changing from a borrowed dress back into her uniform in the same room, she is forced to resign and return to the United States.
The climax of the story comes with the epic Battle of Saint-Mihiel. David is shot down and presumed dead. However, he survives the crash landing, steals a German biplane, and heads for the Allied lines. By a tragic stroke of bad luck, Jack spots the enemy aircraft and, bent on avenging his friend, begins an attack. He is successful in downing the aircraft and lands to retrieve a souvenir of his victory. The owner of the land where David's aircraft crashed urges Jack to come to the dying man's side. He agrees and becomes distraught when he realizes what he has done. David consoles him and before he dies, forgives his comrade.
At the war's end, Jack returns home to a hero's welcome. He visits David's grieving parents to return his friend's effects. During the visit he begs their forgiveness for causing David's death. Mrs. Armstrong says it is not Jack who is responsible for her son's death, but the war.

Ben Price, the detective who put him away the first time is called to the case, but although he knows it is Jimmy (because of the style the crimes were committed with) he cannot find him. Jimmy has actually fled and he is currently in the small town of Elmore, Arkansas, with plans to rob the local bank there.
However, he finds himself love struck by the banker's beautiful daughter, Annabel Adams, and begins to fall in love with her. In order to get such a beautiful girl, he decides to turn over a new leaf and give up his criminal career and take another alias, Ralph D. Spencer.

At the end, he is rescued from Tong members by the timely arrival of the police, led by a cop (Harry Gribbon) who had been the unintentional victim of several of Buster's antics over the last few days. The cop tries to have him committed to the mental hospital, but Buster makes his escape with his camera intact.
Returning to MGM, Buster and the newsreel company's boss are dismayed to find that he apparently forgot to load film into his camera. When Sally finds herself in trouble for giving Buster the tip, Buster offers to make amends by leaving MGM alone once and for all.
Buster returns to his old job, but does not give up on filming, setting up to record a boat race. He then discovers that he has Tong footage after all; the mischievous monkey had switched the reels. Sally and Harold are speeding along in one of the boats. When Harold makes too sharp a turn, the two are thrown into the river. Harold saves himself, but Sally is trapped by the circling boat. Buster stops filming to jump in and rescues her. The monkey gets behind the camera to film the daring rescue. When Buster rushes to a drug store to get medical supplies to revive her, Harold returns and takes credit for the rescue. The two go off, leaving the broken-hearted Buster behind.
Buster decides to send his Tong footage to MGM free of charge. The boss decides to screen it for Harold and Sally for laughs, but is thrilled by what he sees, calling it the best camerawork he has seen in years. They also see footage of Buster's boat footage and the monkey's shot of Buster's rescue of Sally. The boss sends Sally to get Buster. She tells him he is in for a great reception. Buster assumes a ticker-tape parade is in his honor, whereas it is really for Charles Lindbergh.",buster buster keaton sidewalk tintyp portrait photograph new york citi develop crush salli marcelin day secretari work mgm newsreel near purchas old film camera empti bank account attempt get job one mgm filmer harold harold goodwin mgm cameraman design salli mock ambit salli howev encourag buster suggest film anyth everyth buster first attempt show total lack experi doubl expos expos much footag rest simpli good despit setback salli agre go buster sunday date cancel go citi plung pool buster get involv numer mishap later harold offer salli ride home buster sit rumbl seat get drench rain next day salli give hot tip receiv someth big go happen chinatown rush get accident run organ grinder fall appar kill monkey nearbi cop make buster pay monkey take bodi monkey turn daze join buster ventur chinatown buster film outbreak tong war narrowli escap death sever occas end rescu tong member time arriv polic led cop harri gribbon unintent victim sever buster antic last day cop tri commit mental hospit buster make escap camera intact return mgm buster newsreel compani boss dismay find appar forgot load film camera salli find troubl give buster tip buster offer make amend leav mgm alon buster return old job give film set record boat race discov tong footag mischiev monkey switch reel salli harold speed along one boat harold make sharp turn two thrown river harold save salli trap circl boat buster stop film jump rescu monkey get behind camera film dare rescu buster rush drug store get medic suppli reviv harold return take credit rescu two go leav brokenheart buster behind buster decid send tong footag mgm free charg boss decid screen harold salli laugh thrill see call best camerawork seen year also see footag buster boat footag monkey shot buster rescu salli boss send salli get buster tell great recept buster assum tickertap parad honor wherea realli charl lindbergh
1928,The Cardboard Lover,American,Robert Z. Leonard,"Marion Davies, Nils Asther",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cardboard_Lover,"A group of American coeds/flappers arrives at the Hotel Venitien on the French Riviera. In the hotel lobby, Sally Baxter encounters Monsieur de Segurola, ""the famous baritone"", and asks him to write something in her autograph album. However, when she reads what he has written, she tears it out. Next, she spots handsome Andre Briault, ""the famous tennis champion"", and his girlfriend Simone. After Andre drives away, Sally notices Simone and de Sugorola making eye contact. (Albine, Andre's valet, does not approve of Simone either.)
When Andre later telephones Simone, he hears someone singing; Simone claims it is only a phonograph record playing, but then de Sugorola coughs. Andre heads over to the hotel to check up on her. She tries to distract him, but Andre spots de Sugorola trying to sneak out of her suite, tosses him out into the hall and breaks up with Simone.
The last part is witnessed by Sally. She chases after Andre to get his autograph, but her pen seems to be out of ink. After he leaves, she finds that there is ink after all; unable to get a taxi, she steals a car and follows him to the Casino. There, she inadvertently loses 50,000 francs playing baccarat against him, and is asked to pay. She writes on a check that she has no money to speak of, and Andre good-naturedly tears it up.
Then Andre spots Simone. He is still in love with her, so Sally suggests he pretend to be in love with someone else. He thinks that is an excellent plan; he chooses Sally, telling her that this is how she can pay her gambling debt. He instructs Sally to never let him be alone with Simone and to not let him weaken. When Simone tries to win him back, he introduces her to his ""fiancée"", Sally.
However, he keeps falling for Simone's enticements. Fortunately, Sally is extremely persistent, going to outlandish lengths to keep him out of her rival's clutches. Finally, she socks him in the jaw to stop him from chasing after Simone. He reacts by pushing her clear into the next room, knocking her unconscious. This finally makes him realize whom he truly loves.",group american coedsflapp arriv hotel venitien french riviera hotel lobbi salli baxter encount monsieur de segurola famou bariton ask write someth autograph album howev read written tear next spot handsom andr briault famou tenni champion girlfriend simon andr drive away salli notic simon de sugorola make eye contact albin andr valet approv simon either andr later telephon simon hear someon sing simon claim phonograph record play de sugorola cough andr head hotel check tri distract andr spot de sugorola tri sneak suit toss hall break simon last part wit salli chase andr get autograph pen seem ink leav find ink unabl get taxi steal car follow casino inadvert lose 50000 franc play baccarat ask pay write check money speak andr goodnaturedli tear andr spot simon still love salli suggest pretend love someon els think excel plan choos salli tell pay gambl debt instruct salli never let alon simon let weaken simon tri win back introduc fiancé salli howev keep fall simon entic fortun salli extrem persist go outlandish length keep rival clutch final sock jaw stop chase simon react push clear next room knock unconsci final make realiz truli love

1928,The Circus,American,Charles Chaplin,Charles Chaplin,"comedy, adventure",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circus_(film),"At a circus midway, the penniless and hungry Tramp (Chaplin) is mistaken for a condemnable pickpocket and chased by both the police and the real crook (the latter having stashed a stolen wallet and watch in the Tramp's pocket to avoid detection). Running away, the Tramp stumbles into the middle of a performance and unknowingly becomes the hit of the show.
The ringmaster/proprietor of the struggling circus gives him a tryout the next day, but the Tramp fails miserably. However, when the property men quit because they have not been paid, he gets hired on the spot to take their place. Once again, he inadvertently creates comic mayhem during a show. The ringmaster craftily hires him as a poorly paid property man.
The Tramp befriends Merna (Kennedy), a horse rider who is treated badly by her ringmaster stepfather. She later informs the Tramp that he is the star of the show, forcing the ringmaster to pay him accordingly. With the circus thriving because of him, the Tramp also is able to secure better treatment for Merna.
After overhearing a fortune teller inform Merna that she sees ""love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now"", the overjoyed Tramp buys a ring from another clown. Alas for him, she meets Rex (Crocker), the newly hired tightrope walker. The Tramp eavesdrops as she rushes to tell the fortune teller that she has fallen in love with the new man. With his heart broken, the Tramp is unable to entertain the crowds. After several poor performances, the ringmaster warns him he has only one more chance.
When Rex cannot be found for a performance, the ringmaster (knowing that the Tramp has been practicing the tightrope act in hopes of supplanting his rival) sends the Tramp out in his place. Despite a few mishaps, including several mischievous escaped monkeys, he manages to survive the experience. However, when he sees the ringmaster slapping Merna around afterward, he beats the man and is fired.
Merna runs away to join him. The Tramp finds and brings Rex back with him to marry Merna. The trio go back to the circus. The ringmaster starts berating his stepdaughter, but stops when Rex informs him that she is his wife. When the traveling circus leaves, the Tramp remains behind : he prefers to fade to allow them to be happy. Melancholic, he picks himself up and starts walking jauntily away.",circu midway penniless hungri tramp chaplin mistaken condemn pickpocket chase polic real crook latter stash stolen wallet watch tramp pocket avoid detect run away tramp stumbl middl perform unknowingli becom hit show ringmasterproprietor struggl circu give tryout next day tramp fail miser howev properti men quit paid get hire spot take place inadvert creat comic mayhem show ringmast craftili hire poorli paid properti man tramp befriend merna kennedi hors rider treat badli ringmast stepfath later inform tramp star show forc ringmast pay accordingli circu thrive tramp also abl secur better treatment merna overhear fortun teller inform merna see love marriag dark handsom man near overjoy tramp buy ring anoth clown ala meet rex crocker newli hire tightrop walker tramp eavesdrop rush tell fortun teller fallen love new man heart broken tramp unabl entertain crowd sever poor perform ringmast warn one chanc rex found perform ringmast know tramp practic tightrop act hope supplant rival send tramp place despit mishap includ sever mischiev escap monkey manag surviv experi howev see ringmast slap merna around afterward beat man fire merna run away join tramp find bring rex back marri merna trio go back circu ringmast start berat stepdaught stop rex inform wife travel circu leav tramp remain behind prefer fade allow happi melanchol pick start walk jauntili away

In April, they quarrel and Mary threatens to leave. She is shocked and hurt when he does not try to stop her, but the couple reconcile when she reveals she is pregnant. She gives birth to a son. The next five years produce a daughter and an $8 raise, but Mary is dissatisfied with John's lack of advancement, especially compared to Bert, and John's big talk about his prospects.
Finally, John wins $500 for an advertising slogan; he buys presents for his family. However, when he and Mary urge their children to rush home to see their gifts, their daughter is run over by a truck. John is so deeply affected, he cannot concentrate at work. When reprimanded, he quits.

1928,The Docks of New York,American,Josef von Sternberg,"George Bancroft, Betty Compson, Olga Baclanova",melodrama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Docks_of_New_York,"An American tramp steamer docks in New York harbor sometime in the early years of the 20th Century before prohibition. In the bowels of the ship, coal stokers are shutting down the furnaces and anticipating a night of shore leave. The bullying third engineer, Andy (Mitchell Lewis) warns the exhausted crew that they will be punished if they return drunk when the vessel sails the following morning. The stokers gather to leer at crude pornographic graffiti scrawled on the engine room wall before debarking to carouse at the local gin-mills.
On shore, Andy enters the ""The Sandbar"", dance-hall saloon, craving a beer and female companionship. He has unexpected encounter with his estranged wife, Lou (Olga Bachonova). During his absence of three years, she has become a habitué of the saloon, where she freely enjoys male companionship. The “couple” joins one another for a drink: no love is lost between them.
The stoker Bill Roberts - a swaggering brawler when on leave - rescues a drowning prostitute named Mae (Betty Compson) who has leapt off the dock to end her sordid life. Bill, ignoring the admonishment of his sidekick “Sugar” Steve (Clyde Cook), impassively carries the semi-conscious woman to a room above ""The Sandbar"", indifferent to the protests from the proprietor’s wife, Mrs. Crimp (May Foster). Lou intercedes to provide first-aid and revives Mae, a fallen angel like herself. Bill’s growing awareness of Mae’s physical beauty assumes a proprietary quality. He fetches her a beverage from the bar and presents her with a pretty dress he steals from a pawn shop next door. Bill exhorts her to join him for the evening, and Mae, distraught and vulnerable, accepts his invitation. They meet downstairs in the raucous tavern.
Andy attempts to pull rank and cut in on the couple, but the powerful stoker drives him off with blows. Lou, observing her husband’s boorishness, looks on with contempt. Mae and Bill mutually confess their sexual histories to one another, she with regret, he with masculine pride. So as to win Mae’s favors for the night, Bill consents to marry her on the spot and Mae wistfully obliges.
The local missionary “Hymn Book” Harry (Gustav von Seyffertitz) is summoned and sternly delivers the sacrament. Lou provides Mae with a ring: her own, now superfluous wedding ring. The couple takes their vows, each shamefacedly, while the formerly boisterous patrons observe with mock solemnity, then erupt in cheers when the newlyweds kiss.
The following morning, Bill slips quietly from the flophouse honeymoon suite, without a word to Mae. Andy, observing that the stoker is abandoning his “wife”, goes to Mae’s room, where she has just discovered Bill’s desertion. Andy attempts to force himself on her, but Lou arrives and guns him down. The police suspect Mae of the murder, but Lou confesses and is arrested.
Under the blandishments of “Sugar” Steve, Bill takes leave of Mae - the influence of the possessive ""Sugar"" Steve. Driven to distraction by his perfidy, she angrily drives him from the her room.
Aboard the steamer, Bill has an epiphany. He bolts from the subterranean furnaces to the sunny deck, leaps overboard and swims to shore. There he inquires as to Mae’s whereabouts and discovers that she is in custody at Night Court, charged with stealing the clothing he had bestowed on her. Moments after the judge sentences her to jail, Bill presents himself and confesses to the crime, exonerating Mae. He pledges to reunite with Mae after he serves his 60-day sentence, and she agrees to wait for him.",american tramp steamer dock new york harbor sometim earli year 20th centuri prohibit bowel ship coal stoker shut furnac anticip night shore leav bulli third engin andi mitchel lewi warn exhaust crew punish return drunk vessel sail follow morn stoker gather leer crude pornograph graffiti scrawl engin room wall debark carous local ginmil shore andi enter sandbar dancehal saloon crave beer femal companionship unexpect encount estrang wife lou olga bachonova absenc three year becom habitué saloon freeli enjoy male companionship “ coupl ” join one anoth drink love lost stoker bill robert swagger brawler leav rescu drown prostitut name mae betti compson leapt dock end sordid life bill ignor admonish sidekick “ sugar ” steve clyde cook impass carri semiconsci woman room sandbar indiffer protest proprietor ’ wife mr crimp may foster lou interced provid firstaid reviv mae fallen angel like bill ’ grow awar mae ’ physic beauti assum proprietari qualiti fetch beverag bar present pretti dress steal pawn shop next door bill exhort join even mae distraught vulner accept invit meet downstair raucou tavern andi attempt pull rank cut coupl power stoker drive blow lou observ husband ’ boorish look contempt mae bill mutual confess sexual histori one anoth regret masculin pride win mae ’ favor night bill consent marri spot mae wist oblig local missionari “ hymn book ” harri gustav von seyffertitz summon sternli deliv sacrament lou provid mae ring superflu wed ring coupl take vow shamefacedli formerli boister patron observ mock solemn erupt cheer newlyw kiss follow morn bill slip quietli flophous honeymoon suit without word mae andi observ stoker abandon “ wife ” goe mae ’ room discov bill ’ desert andi attempt forc lou arriv gun polic suspect mae murder lou confess arrest blandish “ sugar ” steve bill take leav mae influenc possess sugar steve driven distract perfidi angrili drive room aboard steamer bill epiphani bolt subterranean furnac sunni deck leap overboard swim shore inquir mae ’ whereabout discov custodi night court charg steal cloth bestow moment judg sentenc jail bill present confess crime exoner mae pledg reunit mae serv 60day sentenc agre wait

She is hired nonetheless, having been deemed sexy enough, while still ignorant of the set-up. She refuses to wear the skimpy costume assigned and is given a white puritan-style costume instead. Before the show, the manager greets aristocrat Henri D'Avril (Lowell Sherman), giving him a menu (of sorts) of the showgirls from which to choose. When he asks if there is anyone new, he is directed to Toni's name on the program. When Toni begins her performance in earnest, the audience starts to slumber, given her conservative dress. But the manager directs a lighting change, which causes her translucent clothing become highly revealing and quite nearly see-through. Through their reaction, Toni realizes what has happened and runs off the stage where she is comforted by the wardrobe woman, Rosa (Louise Dresser), the only friend she's made since arriving in the city.
However, Madame Bauer is not through with Toni yet, she has arranged a rendezvous for her with D’Avril in a room off the stage. Once locked inside with Toni, he quickly tries to take advantage. She struggles against his advances which are heard by Rosa, who is able to come to her rescue. When Madame Bauer discovers that her client didn't get what he wanted, she fires Toni and Rosa on the spot. Conveniently, Rosa was about to leave on a two-week vacation anyway and persuades the forlorn Toni to go with her. They go to Monte Carlo, but Toni is now suspicious of other people's motives. So when Rosa signs the Eden Hotel register as Baroness & her daughter, Toni accuses her of being no better than Madame Bauer. However, Rosa has documentation which proves that she is in fact a Baroness, and tells Toni that she signed the registration that way because she wishes it were so. Only much of her fortune was lost after the First World War and she can only afford such trips by living frugally for the rest of the year.
Later, when Toni is playing the piano in her room, she is spotted through the window from across the courtyard by Richard (Charles Ray). In an amusing scene, he tries to get her attention by signaling her, turning on & off the lights in his room. As a gag, she responds with same, causing everyone else on his entire side of the hotel to do it too. When Rosa sees it, she stops the nonsense. However, Richard then decides to call Toni's room, but Rosa answers and decides to invite him over to put a stop to it. She plays the piano while she waits for Richard to arrive. But he arrives at Rosa's door, where Toni is. Tired of unwanted suitors, she appears uninterested in his flirting, yet doesn't reveal him when Rosa returns & he hides behind a door. Colonel Dupont (Edward Martindel) arrives to call on Rosa, but is instantly entranced by Toni. In the doorway, he asks the two ladies to dinner which is witnessed by Richard, who just moments earlier had escaped from their room via another door. Upon hearing their acceptance, Richard joins them, revealing that the Colonel is his uncle. After the dinner, Richard takes Toni for a walk through the hotel's grounds and garden (the title of the film) and they fall in love, losing track of the time.
The rest of the film has Toni being wooed by both Richard and his uncle with a song one of them wrote on the piano. However, there is a surprise involving D'Avril which threatens Toni's happy ending.",viennes ingénu name toni lebrun corinn griffith determin content current life stay aunt uncl work pretzel bakeri young girl earn correspond cours degre opera singer dream fame stage decid leav small town life travel budapest answer ad palai de pari howev ad sham way get girl cheap stage show wealthier clientel arriv toni confus manag lecher quit possibl lesbian madam bauer maud georg ask show bare leg lieu exhibit sing voic hire nonetheless deem sexi enough still ignor setup refus wear skimpi costum assign given white puritanstyl costum instead show manag greet aristocrat henri davril lowel sherman give menu sort showgirl choos ask anyon new direct toni name program toni begin perform earnest audienc start slumber given conserv dress manag direct light chang caus transluc cloth becom highli reveal quit nearli seethrough reaction toni realiz happen run stage comfort wardrob woman rosa louis dresser friend she made sinc arriv citi howev madam bauer toni yet arrang rendezv ’ avril room stage lock insid toni quickli tri take advantag struggl advanc heard rosa abl come rescu madam bauer discov client didnt get want fire toni rosa spot conveni rosa leav twoweek vacat anyway persuad forlorn toni go go mont carlo toni suspici peopl motiv rosa sign eden hotel regist baro daughter toni accus better madam bauer howev rosa document prove fact baro tell toni sign registr way wish much fortun lost first world war afford trip live frugal rest year later toni play piano room spot window across courtyard richard charl ray amus scene tri get attent signal turn light room gag respond caus everyon els entir side hotel rosa see stop nonsens howev richard decid call toni room rosa answer decid invit put stop play piano wait richard arriv arriv rosa door toni tire unwant suitor appear uninterest flirt yet doesnt reveal rosa return hide behind door colonel dupont edward martindel arriv call rosa instantli entranc toni doorway ask two ladi dinner wit richard moment earlier escap room via anoth door upon hear accept richard join reveal colonel uncl dinner richard take toni walk hotel ground garden titl film fall love lose track time rest film toni woo richard uncl song one wrote piano howev surpris involv davril threaten toni happi end

He has a little address book full of sweethearts, but everywhere he goes, he finds that someone has been there before him, leaving behind with each girl a heart-shaped charm with an anchor inscribed on it. In Central America, he takes a dislike to another sailor, Salami (Armstrong), but before they can settle their differences, they brawl with the police and are thrown in jail. Then Spike notices that Salami has a ring shaped like a heart with an anchor inscribed. He has finally found his nemesis. When they are released, they look for a private place to fight, but accidentally fall into the water. Oddly, Spike cannot swim, so when Salami rescues him, they become the best of friends. Inseparable, they sail the seas on the same ships.
Just before they reach Marseille, Spike tells Salami he has finally saved enough money to buy a house and some horses, cows and chickens, but Salami scoffs at the idea. When they dock, Salami has to stay aboard due to a toothache and worries the Spike will get into trouble without him. Sure enough, that is what happens. At a carnival, Spike becomes entranced by the high diver ""Mam'selle Godiva"" (Brooks). When the barker signals her that Spike gave him the most money to watch her performance, she latches onto him. He is so in love with her that he asks her if she would like to settle down with him; she leads him on so she can get the rest of his money.
When Spike first introduces Salami to her, Salami recognizes her. She was his girlfriend at Coney Island until he left her. She makes it clear that she would very much like to renew their relationship, but he is not interested, nor does he want to hurt Spike by telling him the truth. One night, she sends Spike on an errand so she can visit Salami, whom she finds asleep in bed. She tells him that she has gotten most of Spike's savings and is about to drop him. Salami refuses to take her back; he gets dressed and goes to a bar to get away from her. However, Spike returns to their lodgings and finds her there. He also spots Salami's unmade bed, so he assumes the worst. Meanwhile, Salami gets into a fight with two other sailors and yells for his friend's help. Spike knocks the two men out, then does the same to Salami. After thinking over all the fun they had together, however, he asks Salami if he betrayed him.

Since she needs some help, she allows them to help ""pull a job,"" shaking down a wealthy man for $10,000 after her outraged ""husband"" (Brad) breaks in and finds them in a compromising situation. But when Brad has Gwen hide the money, and tells Dolly that their victim stopped payment on his check, Dolly takes all of the money and makes a quick getaway.
Soon after, Dolly meets a young man named Steve Crandall in Atlantic City for a cement convention. Believing that he is a wealthy plantation owner, she flirts with him. When he proposes they get married that very night, Dolly is shocked, but accepts. She is packing to leave with Steve when Brad shows up, demanding his share of the $10,000. Once again, Dolly uses her wits to escape.
Dolly and Steve take the train south to his home town of Winthrop, Alabama. There Dolly is rudely surprised to discover that Steve is far from rich, nor does he own a plantation (though he lives next door to one). He is certain his invention, Enduro cement, will make his fortune, but his new wife is not so sure. Dolly has grown fond of Steve, but cannot hide her disappointment from him. That evening, she has him take her to a train for New York. The next morning, however, Steve returns to his room to find Dolly curled up in a chair. She is in love with him and has decided to reform, though she keeps her past a secret.
Brad and Gwen track her down, certain she has landed yet another rich sucker. They are surprised to find her living in modest circumstances. Dolly tells them that she has fallen for a poor man, but they do not believe her. To get rid of them, she gives them the $10,000. However, Steve receives a telegram informing him that a company has bought his cement formula for $100,000. Overjoyed, he rushes home and tells Dolly, his mother, and ""cousins"" Brad and Gwen.

1928,The Last Command,American,Josef von Sternberg,"Emil Jannings, Evelyn Brent, William Powell",melodrama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Command_(1928_film),"In 1928 Hollywood, director Leo Andreyev (William Powell) looks through photographs for actors for his next movie. When he comes to the picture of an aged Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings), he pauses, then tells his assistant (Jack Raymond) to cast the man. Sergius shows up at the Eureka Studio with a horde of other extras and is issued a general's uniform. As he is dressing, another actor complains that his continual head twitching is distracting. Sergius apologizes and explains that it is the result of a great shock he once experienced.
The film then flashes back ten years to Czarist Russia, which is in the midst of the Revolution. Grand Duke Sergius Alexander, the Czar's cousin and commander of all his armies, is informed by his adjutant that two actors entertaining the troops have been identified as dangerous ""revolutionists"" during a routine passport check. He decides to toy with them for his amusement. When one of them, Leo Andreyev, becomes insolent, Sergius whips him across the face and has him jailed.
Leo's companion, the beautiful Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent), is an entirely different matter. She intrigues Sergius. Despite the danger she poses, he takes her along with him. After a week, he gives her a pearl necklace as a token of his feelings for her. She comes to realize that he is at heart a man of great honor who loves Russia as deeply as she does. When she invites him to her room, he spots a partially hidden pistol, but deliberately turns his back to her. She draws the weapon, but cannot fire. Despite their political differences, she has fallen in love with him.
When the Bolsheviks capture the train on which they are traveling, she pretends to despise him. Instead of having him shot out of hand like his officers, she suggests they have him stoke coal into the locomotive all the way to Petrograd, where he will be publicly hanged. When everyone is drunk, however, she helps him escape, giving him back the pearl necklace to finance his way out of the country. Sergius jumps from the train, then watches in horror as it tumbles off a nearby bridge into the icy river below, taking Natalie with it. This moment is when Sergius develops his head twitch.
Ten years later, Sergius is reduced to poverty, eking out a living as a Hollywood extra. When he and the director finally meet, Sergius recognizes him. Leo, in an ironic act calculated to humiliate him, casts him as a Russian general in a battle scene. He is directed to give a speech to a group of actors playing his dispirited men. When one soldier tries to incite a mutiny, telling the general that ""you've given your last command"", he whips the man in the face as instructed, just as he had once struck Leo. Losing his grip on reality, he imagines himself genuinely on the battlefield, besieged by enemies, and passionately urges his men to fight for Russia. Overstraining himself, he dies, inquiring with his last words if they have won. Moved, Leo tells him they have. The assistant remarks, ""That guy was a great actor."" Leo replies, ""He was more than a great actor - he was a great man.""",1928 hollywood director leo andreyev william powel look photograph actor next movi come pictur age sergiu alexand emil jan paus tell assist jack raymond cast man sergiu show eureka studio hord extra issu gener uniform dress anoth actor complain continu head twitch distract sergiu apolog explain result great shock experienc film flash back ten year czarist russia midst revolut grand duke sergiu alexand czar cousin command armi inform adjut two actor entertain troop identifi danger revolutionist routin passport check decid toy amus one leo andreyev becom insol sergiu whip across face jail leo companion beauti natali dabrova evelyn brent entir differ matter intrigu sergiu despit danger pose take along week give pearl necklac token feel come realiz heart man great honor love russia deepli invit room spot partial hidden pistol deliber turn back draw weapon fire despit polit differ fallen love bolshevik captur train travel pretend despis instead shot hand like offic suggest stoke coal locomot way petrograd publicli hang everyon drunk howev help escap give back pearl necklac financ way countri sergiu jump train watch horror tumbl nearbi bridg ici river take natali moment sergiu develop head twitch ten year later sergiu reduc poverti eke live hollywood extra director final meet sergiu recogn leo iron act calcul humili cast russian gener battl scene direct give speech group actor play dispirit men one soldier tri incit mutini tell gener youv given last command whip man face instruct struck leo lose grip realiti imagin genuin battlefield besieg enemi passion urg men fight russia overstrain die inquir last word move leo tell assist remark guy great actor leo repli great actor great man
1928,"Laugh, Clown, Laugh",American,Herbert Brenon,"Lon Chaney, Loretta Young",melodrama,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh,_Clown,_Laugh","Tito (Lon Chaney), a traveling circus clown, finds an abandoned child. Tito adopts her and raises her as his daughter, naming her Simonetta after his brother Simon (Bernard Siegel). One day the now teen-aged Simonetta (Loretta Young) encounters Luigi (Nils Asther), a wealthy man who falls madly in love with her, but upon seeing that he already has a girlfriend, she rejects him. She returns home to the circus and Tito suddenly realizes she is no longer a child. Tito further realizes he has feelings for Simonetta, but also knows his feelings are improper because he raised her as his daughter.
Luigi begins having fits of uncontrollable laughter because Simonetta has rejected him. Tito falls into melancholia because of his conflicted interests about Simonetta. They both see the same doctor about their conditions and meet for the first time. They share their respective troubles and believe they can help each other, not knowing they both love the same woman. Nonetheless, the three eventually develop a strong friendship until Luigi asks Simonetta to marry him. Simonetta eventually accepts Luigi's proposal, which throws Tito into an even deeper melancholy. Simonetta learns of Tito's affections for her before she marries Luigi. She tells Tito she loved him before she loved Luigi, then goes to break her engagement with Luigi.
While Simonetta is breaking her engagement, Tito and Simon begin rehearsing some new material for their Flik and Flok act. Tito does not believe Simonetta's love is genuine, but that it is just pity and at the same time, he knows that as her adopted father - it would not be right to have her as his wife. Driven insane by his internal conflict, he decides to practice his new routine from the act without protection. Despite his brother Simon's protests, he continues with the stunt and falls from the highwire.
Tito dies from his fall, freeing Simonetta to marry Luigi.

The unit is composed mostly of American volunteer pilots flying fighter aircraft. All four men are running away from something: the law, love, or themselves. Whenever a dangerous mission comes up, the four men draw cards to see who will fly off to near-certain doom. With his best friend Byron Dashwood (Barry Norton) already having died in combat, Gale Price (Gary Cooper) draws the high card next time around.
As he prepares to drop a spy behind enemy lines, Gale remembers the events leading up to this moment - recounting his ill-fated romance with Christine Charteris (Fay Wray), whom he now believes to be a German spy. As he approaches his aircraft, Gale discovers that his passenger is Christine, who is actually an operative in the French secret service. Before she can explain her true identity, Gale is obliged to fly Christine to her rendezvous point.
Both young people are captured with Christine sentenced to be executed as a spy. Just before they go to the firing squad, a bombing raid takes place. Afterward, they are rescued by their unit and reconciled.[2]",world war four young men variou walk life sign flyer lafayett escadril militari unit known legion condemn unit compos mostli american volunt pilot fli fighter aircraft four men run away someth law love whenev danger mission come four men draw card see fli nearcertain doom best friend byron dashwood barri norton alreadi die combat gale price gari cooper draw high card next time around prepar drop spi behind enemi line gale rememb event lead moment recount illfat romanc christin charteri fay wray believ german spi approach aircraft gale discov passeng christin actual oper french secret servic explain true ident gale oblig fli christin rendezv point young peopl captur christin sentenc execut spi go fire squad bomb raid take place afterward rescu unit reconciled2
1928,Lights of New York,American,Bryan Foy,"Helene Costello, Cullen Landis, Eugene Pallette","crime, drama",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_of_New_York_(1928_film),"When bootleggers Jake Jackson (Walter Percival) and Dan Dickson (Jere Delaney), who have been hiding out in a small upstate New York town, learn that they finally can return to New York, they try to convince a young kid named Eddie Morgan (Cullen Landis) and his friend, a local barber named Gene (Eugene Palette) to come with them.
With a promise from Jackson and Dickson that they will help the young men establish a barbershop in the city, Eddie asks his mother, Mrs. Morgan (Mary Carr), who owns the town's Morgan Hotel, to loan them $5,000 of her savings. Eddie and Gene set up the barbershop in New York but soon learn that it is merely a front for a speakeasy.
Frustrated and yearning for a return to the quiet life, Gene and Eddie vow to go home as soon as they earn enough to pay back Mrs. Morgan. Eddie is in love with Kitty Lewis (top-billed Helene Costello), his hometown sweetheart, who preceded him to New York. Now she is a performer at The Night Hawk, a nightclub owned by Hawk Miller (Wheeler Oakman), notorious bootlegger who controls the speakeasy behind the barbershop. Although Hawk's longtime mistress, Molly Thompson (Gladys Brockwell), warns him not to pursue Kitty, he coldly dismisses her, saying that their relationship is over.
After a police officer is killed in a bootlegging raid of a supply of Old Century liquor, Hawk tells his henchmen, Sam (Tom Dugan) and Collins (Tom McGuire), that they must find someone to take the blame to keep the police from closing him down. They suggest that Hawk frame Eddie, thereby ""killing two birds with one stone."" When Eddie comes to the club to visit Kitty, Hawk summons him to his office and asks him to hide his supply of Old Century, saying that it is only temporary, in case the police raid his club. When Detective Crosby (Robert Elliott) comes to the club to question Hawk and implies that he is behind the policeman's murder, Hawk says that the only person he knows who has a supply of Old Century is Eddie.
A short time later, Hawk goes to the barbershop and is killed by an unknown assailant. Fearing that they will be blamed, Eddie and Gene put Hawk's body in a barber chair and rub his face with shaving cream just as Crosby arrives at the shop. After Eddie leaves, a nervous Gene pretends to shave Hawk, but the body slides from the chair, revealing its identity to Crosby. Although Gene swears that the absent Eddie is innocent, Crosby deduces that Eddie has gone to Kitty's apartment and follows him there. Crosby is about to arrest Eddie and Kitty, when Molly arrives and reveals that she killed Hawk because he no longer wanted her. As there was a reward for the killer of the policeman, dead or alive, Crosby tells Molly that things will not go badly for her. Now freed from their obligation to Hawk, Kitty and Eddie take the next train home.",bootlegg jake jackson walter perciv dan dickson jere delaney hide small upstat new york town learn final return new york tri convinc young kid name eddi morgan cullen landi friend local barber name gene eugen palett come promis jackson dickson help young men establish barbershop citi eddi ask mother mr morgan mari carr own town morgan hotel loan 5000 save eddi gene set barbershop new york soon learn mere front speakeasi frustrat yearn return quiet life gene eddi vow go home soon earn enough pay back mr morgan eddi love kitti lewi topbil helen costello hometown sweetheart preced new york perform night hawk nightclub own hawk miller wheeler oakman notori bootlegg control speakeasi behind barbershop although hawk longtim mistress molli thompson gladi brockwel warn pursu kitti coldli dismiss say relationship polic offic kill bootleg raid suppli old centuri liquor hawk tell henchmen sam tom dugan collin tom mcguir must find someon take blame keep polic close suggest hawk frame eddi therebi kill two bird one stone eddi come club visit kitti hawk summon offic ask hide suppli old centuri say temporari case polic raid club detect crosbi robert elliott come club question hawk impli behind policeman murder hawk say person know suppli old centuri eddi short time later hawk goe barbershop kill unknown assail fear blame eddi gene put hawk bodi barber chair rub face shave cream crosbi arriv shop eddi leav nervou gene pretend shave hawk bodi slide chair reveal ident crosbi although gene swear absent eddi innoc crosbi deduc eddi gone kitti apart follow crosbi arrest eddi kitti molli arriv reveal kill hawk longer want reward killer policeman dead aliv crosbi tell molli thing go badli freed oblig hawk kitti eddi take next train home

1928,The Matinee Idol,American,Frank Capra,"Bessie Love, Johnnie Walker",romance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matinee_Idol,"Don Wilson, a famous blackface comedian, is preparing to headline a new show. Arnold Wingate, his manager, persuades him to take a weekend off in the country. When their car breaks down, they go off in search of a mechanic.
Don happens upon a ramshackle traveling theatrical stock company run by Jasper Bolivar and his daughter Ginger. One of the actors has quit, so Ginger is holding an audition. When Don asks the hopefuls in line about a garage, Ginger mistakes him for one of the applicants and chooses him as the best of a bad lot. Amused (and attracted to Ginger), he accepts the job, giving his name as ""Harry Mann"". Playing a dying Union soldier, Don has one line (""I love you."") and gets kissed by Ginger's character.
The show, an American Civil War melodrama, is terribly amateurish, but the audience does not know any better and applauds appreciatively. Don's friends attend the show and laugh, particularly at his hijinks. (Don repeats his line several times, forcing Ginger to kiss him over and over again.) Afterward, Ginger fires him for his bad acting.
Wingate has an idea; he signs the company for his Broadway show as a comedy act, though the Bolivars and the rest of the actors are deceived into believing their play has been appreciated. Don has Wingate stipulate that the entire cast be included, so Ginger reluctantly rehires him. He insists on a raise.
During rehearsals, Don maintains his disguise by wearing blackface. Even so, he is nearly caught out by Ginger; hurriedly putting on a costume to hide his face, Don has to invent a masquerade party as a reason, and invites her and her troupe to attend. During the party, he tries to seduce her. When she rejects him, he is pleased, certain that she has feelings for his alter-ego.
On opening night, Don has second thoughts about the humiliation the Bolivar troupe is about to face, but it is too late to do anything about it. When ""Harry Mann"" cannot be found, Don offers to take his place. All goes as Wingate had anticipated; the audience laughs wildly, as the confused actors continue performing. At the end, Ginger finally realizes what is going on and berates the audience, then walks out into the rain. When Don follows to console her, the rain washes away his makeup and reveals his true identity.
She and her father return to their old work. A contrite Don shows up at the audition for a replacement actor.

While on a leave, he secretly marries Rose, the ""village belle"", but he only has time for a few kisses and a hug before he has to return to the fighting. After the Armistice, Major Hatton comes home, only to be told by Marvin Swallow that his wife's parents have had their marriage annulled, as she was not of age. Rose married wealthy Lon Henderson and the couple went abroad. Les returns to farming.
One day, the Hendersons return. Rose, disillusioned by Lon's repeated infidelity, throws herself at Les. He weakens and embraces her, but then Lon shows up. The two men struggle when Lon pulls out a gun. Fortunately no one is hurt, and Les invents a French wife on her way to the farm so he will be left alone.
He goes to Ellis Island in search of a real wife. An official directs him to Catherine and her parents, poor would-be immigrants who are facing deportation. He offers to marry her in exchange for the family being allowed to settle in America. Her parents strongly oppose the bargain, but she accepts. That night, Catherine is prepared to share her bed with her husband, but sensing her resigned attitude, Les decides at the last minute to sleep alone in another room. They gradually fall in love.
Meanwhile, Lon decides to break off his affair with young Jessie Peebles. When Marvin asks her to marry him, she asks for a little time to consider. Les later finds her lifeless body in a pond on his farm. Lon, a member of the local Ku Klux Klan-like Order, insinuates that Les must have had something to do with Jessie's suicide.

The men sent to fetch Lon find him dead in his office and Marvin hiding with a gun. They take him back to the Order meeting. He denies having killed Lon and produces Lon's love letters to Jessie, exonerating Les. The head of the Order rules that, even if Marvin did not kill Lon, he would have been justified to do so. One of his men stages it to look like suicide. (Judge Peebles, Jessie's father, is shown at home, unloading and cleaning his gun.

Though she repulses his first advance, she does spend an idyllic day with him in the countryside.
Karl is called away to duty, however. Colonel Eric von Raden (Edward Connelly), his uncle and the chief of the secret police, gives him secret plans to deliver to Berlin. He also warns his nephew that the woman is Tania Fedorova, a Russian spy. Tania comes to him aboard the train, professing to love him, but he tells her he knows who she is. Dejected, she leaves.
The next morning, when Karl wakes up, he finds the plans have been stolen. As a result, he is sentenced to military degradation and imprisonment for treason. However, Colonel von Raden visits him in prison and arranges for his release. He sends his nephew to Warsaw, posing as a Serbian pianist, to seek out the identity of the real traitor and thus exonerate himself.
In Warsaw, by chance, Karl is asked to play at a private party where he once again crosses paths with Tania. She is being escorted by General Boris Alexandroff (Gustav von Seyffertitz), the infatuated head of the Russian Military Intelligence Department. Foolhardily, Karl plays a tune from the opera they attended together. She recognizes it, but does not betray him. As the party goers are leaving, she slips away for a few stolen moments with her love. The jealous Alexandroff suspects their feelings for each other. He hires Karl to play the next day at a ball he is giving at his mansion for Tania's birthday.
While Alexandroff and Tania are alone in his home office, he receives a parcel containing the latest secrets stolen by the traitor, whom he casually identifies as Max Heinrich. Later, Tania steals the documents, gives them to Karl, and sends him out via a secret passage. However, it is all a trap. Alexandroff comes in and tells Tania that what she stole was mere blank paper; he shows her the real documents. He pulls out a gun and announces that he intends to use it on Karl, who has been captured outside. She struggles with Alexandroff and manages to fatally shoot him; the sound goes unheard amidst the merriment of the party.

1928,Noah's Ark,American,Michael Curtiz,"George O'Brien, Alois Reiser",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark_(1928_film),"The film opens after the great flood, with Noah and his family outside of the Ark praising the Lord. Then comes depictions of the building of the Tower of Babel and the worshipping of the golden calf. Then it switches to the eve of World War I. The theme of the gold calf is carried forward by a scene in which a bankrupted trader (Otto Hoffman) shoots his uncaring stockbroker.
In 1914, American playboy Travis (George O'Brien) and his New York taxi driver buddy Al (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) are traveling aboard the ""Oriental Express"" train. Travis helps a pious minister (Paul McAllister) reclaim his seat from a rude fellow passenger. A washed-out bridge causes a deadly derailment. Travis and Al rescue Marie (Dolores Costello), a German member of a small theatrical troupe, from underneath the wreckage with the help of a prisoner (Malcolm Waite) who had just unhandcuffed himself from a now-dead escort.
At the nearby lodge where they take shelter, fellow survivor Nickoloff (Noah Beery), an officer in the Russian Secret Service, tries to sneak into Marie's room. When Travis objects, a fight breaks out, during which Nickoloff is cut on the hand by a bottle he was wielding. They are interrupted by French soldiers, who announce that war has broken out. Travis, Al and Marie sneak away in the confusion and head to Paris together. Travis and Marie fall in love.
When America enters the war, Al enlists as soon as he can. Travis tells him he cannot, as he has married Marie. However, when he later sees Al marching with his unit down the streets of Paris, he impulsively joins up as well. He loses touch with his wife.
Travis and Al meet by chance in the trenches. They are each assigned a squad to attack a machine gun nest holding up the American offensive. Tragically, Travis tosses a hand grenade into the position, not knowing that Al had captured it moments before. Al is fatally wounded, but lives long enough to bid his friend adieu.
Later, Nickoloff spots Marie in a group of dancers entertaining the troops. He threatens to have her arrested as a German spy unless she meets him later. When she tries to sneak away, he carries through his threat, and she is sentenced to face a firing squad. She is comforted by the minister from the train. Travis, who by chance is part of the squad, recognizes her in the nick of time. Then the couple and others are trapped below a demolished building by a German artillery barrage. The minister compares the war and its flood of blood to the biblical story of Noah's Ark.
The film reverts to that time, with the actors playing second roles. King Nephilim (Beery) has converted his subjects into worshippers of the god Jaghuth. Only Noah (McAllister) and his family remain faithful to Jehovah. Following Jehovah's command, Noah and his three sons (O'Brien, Williams and Waite) begin building the Ark on a mountainside.
Nephilim orders the sacrifice of the most beautiful virgin in his realm to his god in a month. His soldiers choose Miriam (Costello), a handmaiden of Noah's. When Noah's son Japheth (O'Brien) tries to save her, he is blinded and set to labor turning a stone-mill with other prisoners. Just as Miriam is about to be slain, Jehovah unleashes his wrath, with the great flood destroying and drowning everything in its path. Among the chaos, Japheth, freed from his chains, finds and carries Miriam back to the Ark, where Jehovah restores his sight. Nephilim tries to climb aboard the Ark, only to have the door slam on his hand, inflicting the same injuries Nickoloff suffered.
Returning to World War I, the trapped group is freed.

1928,Sadie Thompson,American,Raoul Walsh,"Gloria Swanson, Lionel Barrymore",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadie_Thompson,"A smoking, drinking, jazz listening, young prostitute named Sadie Thompson (Gloria Swanson) arrives at Pago Pago (now part of American Samoa), on her way to a job with a shipping line on another island. At the same time, 'moralists' arrive, including Mr. and Mrs. Davidson (Lionel Barrymore and Blanche Friderici). They all end up staying in the same hotel, where the Davidsons plot to teach the natives about sin and Sadie entertains a bunch of Marines.
Sadie begins to fall in love with Sergeant Timothy O'Hara (Raoul Walsh), who is not fazed by her past. He tells her that he has a best friend who married a former prostitute, and the couple now live happily in Australia.
Davidson sets about trying to redeem Sadie, much to her disgust. He tricks her into telling him about her past in San Francisco and, once she refuses to repent, he declares that he will go to the Governor and have her deported. Sadie is terrified of the threat, but O'Hara assures her that it will not happen. He tells her he wishes she would go to Australia and wait for his term of service to finish, after which they can get married. She agrees.
Davidson gets his way, however, and Sadie is livid. She and O'Hara go to the Governor, begging him to let her go to Australia instead of back to San Francisco. Davidson has also managed to get O'Hara punished for being immoral, but Sadie will be able to go to Australia instead if Davidson approves. Sadie pleads with him, but to no avail. She eventually confesses that, if she goes back to San Francisco, there is ""a man there who won't let her go straight"", which is what she wants to do. Davidson figures out this means that there is a warrant for her arrest back in San Francisco. Sadie claims that she was framed and is innocent, but will go to prison if she is sent back.
Davidson still refuses, saying she must atone for her past. Sadie pleads and pleads and eventually offers to repent. Davidson, however, says that the only way to fully repent is for her to go to prison. Sadie runs to her room, crying out for Davidson. Davidson returns and Sadie confesses she is afraid. Davidson then tells her that, if she repents, there will be nothing to fear and he begins to pray with her. Sadie converts to Christianity.
Sadie prays for three whole days. She has put away her old things and has become a modest woman. O'Hara returns and finds Davidson is gone, apparently ""trying to stop the locals from dancing on the beach"". O'Hara tells Sadie that he has a fishing boat waiting to take her and her things to a ship that will then take her to Australia, where they can marry and be free. Sadie is extremely afraid and refuses to go, saying that the ""old Sadie is dead"" and she must go to San Francisco and prison, to repent.
O'Hara does everything he can, including forcibly taking her from the room, but Davidson is waiting outside. O'Hara tries to attack him, but Sadie asks him not to. O'Hara, extremely upset, leaves and Sadie pleads with Davidson not to get him in trouble, for ""it was all her fault"".
Later that night, Sadie is asleep and everyone else is heading to bed. Davidson can not sleep and goes out for a walk in the rain. (It has rained almost continuously.) His wife says he cannot sleep for ""the unpleasant dreams he's been having about Miss Thompson"". A fellow boarder suspects they are not ""all that unpleasant"". Outside, Davidson struggles with himself and realizes that he is sexually attracted to Sadie and unable to handle it. He looks into her window and eventually returns to his room.
Sadie, frightened because she heard noises, is waiting in Davidson's room. Davidson is shocked and sends her back to her room. The last reel is missing, but fishermen find Davidson's body. He has committed suicide.

1928,Speedy,American,Ted Wilde,"Harold Lloyd, Ann Christy",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_(film),"Everybody in New York City ""is in such a hurry that they take Saturday's bath on Friday so they can do Monday's washing on Sunday"". But in one slower-paced, ""old-fashioned corner of the city"", Pop Dillon (Burt Woodruff) owns and operates the city's last horse-drawn streetcar. His granddaughter Jane Dillon (Ann Christy) is in love with Harold ""Speedy"" Swift (Harold Lloyd).
Speedy, an avid New York Yankees fan, is working at a soda shop. As well as doing his work, he takes frequent telephone calls during Yankees games and passes the line scores on to the kitchen staff by arranging food items in a display case (such as doughnuts for zeroes). But he loses the job after he is ordered to deliver some flowers and lets someone close a car door on them when he gets distracted by a display of baseball scores in a shop window.
Streetcar magnate W.S. Wilton (Byron Douglas) comes to Pop's home to ask for his price to sell the car line, but Speedy spots a newspaper article and realizes that this is part of a plan to form a streetcar monopoly in the city. He surreptitiously raises Pop's written price from $10,000 to $70,000. Wilton angrily refuses and threatens to force Pop out instead.
Speedy is unworried about being unemployed; he is very much used to losing jobs and finding new ones. He and Jane go to Coney Island, where they greatly enjoy themselves despite various mishaps, such as Speedy ruining his suit jacket by leaning against wet paint. On the way home along with a stray dog that decided to follow them, Speedy proposes to Jane, but she will not marry him until her grandfather's affairs are settled.
Speedy is hired as a taxi driver, but for some time a series of mishaps prevents him from actually taking a passenger, and he antagonizes a policeman. Then, to his delight, Babe Ruth (playing himself) hails the cab to get to Yankee Stadium. Although terrified by Speedy's driving, he offers Speedy a ticket to the game; but the taxi owner is there, sees Speedy in the seats when he should be working, and fires him.
At the stadium, Speedy happens to overhear Wilton on the telephone. Wilton has learned that if Pop fails to operate the horsecar every 24 hours he will lose his right to the line, and orders goons to be sent to disrupt the operation. Speedy rushes home and arranges with small-business owners on the street to organize a defense. The goons are beaten off with the help of Speedy's dog, but return and steal the horse and car.
Again helped by his dog, Speedy finds out where the car has been taken and manages to steal it back. In a madcap chase scene, he brings it back across the city to Pop's tracks, stealing fresh horses, tricking police to avoid being stopped, and replacing a broken wheel with a manhole cover.
When Wilton sees the horsecar in place, he agrees to meet Pop's price. Speedy says that Pop is a bit deaf and won't hear him until he offers $100,000. Wilton agrees, and Speedy suggests to Jane that they plan a visit to Niagara Falls by horsecar.",everybodi new york citi hurri take saturday bath friday monday wash sunday one slowerpac oldfashion corner citi pop dillon burt woodruff own oper citi last horsedrawn streetcar granddaught jane dillon ann christi love harold speedi swift harold lloyd speedi avid new york yanke fan work soda shop well work take frequent telephon call yanke game pass line score kitchen staff arrang food item display case doughnut zero lose job order deliv flower let someon close car door get distract display basebal score shop window streetcar magnat ws wilton byron dougla come pop home ask price sell car line speedi spot newspap articl realiz part plan form streetcar monopoli citi surreptiti rais pop written price 10000 70000 wilton angrili refus threaten forc pop instead speedi unworri unemploy much use lose job find new one jane go coney island greatli enjoy despit variou mishap speedi ruin suit jacket lean wet paint way home along stray dog decid follow speedi propos jane marri grandfath affair settl speedi hire taxi driver time seri mishap prevent actual take passeng antagon policeman delight babe ruth play hail cab get yanke stadium although terrifi speedi drive offer speedi ticket game taxi owner see speedi seat work fire stadium speedi happen overhear wilton telephon wilton learn pop fail oper horsecar everi 24 hour lose right line order goon sent disrupt oper speedi rush home arrang smallbusi owner street organ defens goon beaten help speedi dog return steal hors car help dog speedi find car taken manag steal back madcap chase scene bring back across citi pop track steal fresh hors trick polic avoid stop replac broken wheel manhol cover wilton see horsecar place agre meet pop price speedi say pop bit deaf wont hear offer 100000 wilton agre speedi suggest jane plan visit niagara fall horsecar

He proves a troublesome slave, and Leif's sailing master, Egil the Black (Harry Woods), prepares to kill him for his insolence, but Helga stops him. When Alwin challenges Egil to a sword fight, Leif is impressed by his courage and permits it. Alwin manages to break Egil's sword, but spares him. Helga then gives Alwin to Leif.
Leif, with the support of King Olaf (Roy Stewart), the first Christian king of Norway, sets out to search for lands beyond Greenland, which was discovered by his pagan father, Eric the Red (Anders Randolf). Back in Greenland, Eric kills one of his men after he discovers the man is a Christian. When Leif stops there to pick up supplies, Eric gives his blessing for his marriage to Helga (unbeknownst to her). However, after it is revealed that Leif is himself a Christian, Eric disowns him and refuses to give him any supplies. Fighting breaks out after Leif instructs Alwin to take the supplies anyway. In the confusion, Helga stows away on Leif's ship.
Leif has no choice but to take her along. During the voyage, she and Alwin confess their love for each other. Unaware of this, Leif informs her that he will marry her on the ""second change of the moon"".

When Egil prepares to stab Leif in the back during the wedding ceremony, Alwin leaps in the way and is wounded. Leif kills Egil, but is enraged when Helga reveals that she loves Alwin.

1928,West of Zanzibar,American,Tod Browning,"Lon Chaney, Lionel Barrymore",melodrama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_of_Zanzibar_(1928_film),"Anna (Jacqueline Gadsden) cannot bring herself to tell her professional magician husband, Phroso (Lon Chaney), that she is leaving him. Her lover, Crane (Lionel Barrymore), informs Phroso that he is taking Anna to Africa, shoving the distraught husband away so forcefully that he falls over a railing and is crippled, losing the use of his legs. After a year, Phroso learns that Anna has returned. He finds his wife dead in a church, with a baby beside her. He swears to avenge himself on both Crane and the child.
Eighteen years later, Phroso rules a small outpost inhabited by Doc (Warner Baxter), Babe (Kalla Pasha), Tiny (Tiny Ward) and native Bumbu (Curtis Nero) in the African jungle. Through his magic tricks, he dominates the local tribe. He has his men steal ivory repeatedly from Crane by having Tiny dress up as an evil voodoo spirit to frighten away Crane's porters. Meanwhile, Phroso sends Babe to bring back blonde Maizie (Mary Nolan) from the ""lowest dive in Zanzibar"", where Phroso has had her raised. She is told only that she will finally meet her father.
When she arrives, Phroso denies being Maisie's father (to her great relief), but refuses to tell her why she has been brought there and treats her with undisguised hatred. The first night, she witnesses a gruesome tribal custom: when a man dies, his wife or daughter is burned alive on his funeral pyre. As the days go by, Maizie gradually wins the perpetually drunk Doc's heart. However, Phroso turns her into an alcoholic.
Phroso sends word to Crane where he can find the robber of his ivory. When Crane shows up, Phroso tells Crane that Maizie is his daughter. To Phroso's surprise, Crane breaks out in laughter. He informs Phroso that Anna never went with him because she hated him for paralyzing her husband. Maizie is actually Phroso's child. Before he can absorb the news, the next step of his plan unfolds; the natives shoot and kill Crane.
Phroso uses a magic trick to try to save Maisie from being burned alive. With the natives watching, he puts her in a wooden box with a secret exit and closes it. When he reopens it, there is a skeleton inside. Meanwhile, Doc, Maizie and the others flee by boat. However, the natives do not believe Phroso's claim that an evil spirit has taken Maizie. The screen fades to black as the natives close in on Phroso. Later, a native fishes a medallion out of a bonfire, the same medallion that had hung around Phroso's neck.",anna jacquelin gadsden bring tell profession magician husband phroso lon chaney leav lover crane lionel barrymor inform phroso take anna africa shove distraught husband away forc fall rail crippl lose use leg year phroso learn anna return find wife dead church babi besid swear aveng crane child eighteen year later phroso rule small outpost inhabit doc warner baxter babe kalla pasha tini tini ward nativ bumbu curti nero african jungl magic trick domin local tribe men steal ivori repeatedli crane tini dress evil voodoo spirit frighten away crane porter meanwhil phroso send babe bring back blond maizi mari nolan lowest dive zanzibar phroso rais told final meet father arriv phroso deni maisi father great relief refus tell brought treat undisguis hatr first night wit gruesom tribal custom man die wife daughter burn aliv funer pyre day go maizi gradual win perpetu drunk doc heart howev phroso turn alcohol phroso send word crane find robber ivori crane show phroso tell crane maizi daughter phroso surpris crane break laughter inform phroso anna never went hate paralyz husband maizi actual phroso child absorb news next step plan unfold nativ shoot kill crane phroso use magic trick tri save maisi burn aliv nativ watch put wooden box secret exit close reopen skeleton insid meanwhil doc maizi other flee boat howev nativ believ phroso claim evil spirit taken maizi screen fade black nativ close phroso later nativ fish medallion bonfir medallion hung around phroso neck
1928,West Point,American,Allan Dwan,"William Haines, Joan Crawford",romance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point_(1928_film),"Arrogant and wise-cracking Brice Wayne (William Haines) enrolls at the United States Military Academy at West Point and adjusts to life as a plebe. He tries out for the plebe football team, where he excels and shows up the varsity team. However, his ego is unrivaled, especially in competition with upperclassman Bob Sperry (Neil Neely). At the same time, Brice meets a local girl named Betty Channing (Joan Crawford) who cheers for him at football practices.
A year later, Brice is the star football player for West Point. By this time, both Sperry and Brice are in love with Betty, and while Sperry acts like a gentleman towards Betty, Brice forces a kiss on Betty, only for her to spurn him. Betty continues to reject Brice's advances.
When he is benched for his attitude, Brice decries favoritism by Coach Towers (Raymond G. Moses) to the local paper. After an altercation with the coach in the locker room, Brice shouts ""to hell with the Corps"" and quits the team in a huff. This causes a scandal among the cadets, who move to have the Cadet Honor Committee ""Silence"" Brice.
Brice's roommate Tex McNeil (William Bakewell) tries to reason with him but the angered Brice hits him. Immediately regretting his actions, Brice tries to help. After Brice leaves to contemplate his actions in private, Tex accidentally falls down a flight of stairs. Despite this he pleads with the Honor Committee not to censure Brice—before collapsing with a serious concussion.
Brice writes a letter of resignation from West Point out of shame, but regrets his action when he realizes he needs to help the team. As the train carrying the team to the Army-Navy Game is about to leave, Brice is called before the superintendent. When he indicates both his contrition and an understanding of the ""spirit of the Corps,"" the superintendent hands him back his resignation.
Brice apologizes to the coach for his behavior but is still benched. In the 4th quarter, with Army down, a player is injured and Brice is sent in. Despite an injured arm he scores a touchdown that wins the game for Army, and asks for forgiveness from his team.
As graduation from West Point concludes some years later, he ends in the arms of Betty while enthusiastically observing the traditions of the Corps.",arrog wisecrack brice wayn william hain enrol unit state militari academi west point adjust life plebe tri plebe footbal team excel show varsiti team howev ego unriv especi competit upperclassman bob sperri neil neeli time brice meet local girl name betti chan joan crawford cheer footbal practic year later brice star footbal player west point time sperri brice love betti sperri act like gentleman toward betti brice forc kiss betti spurn betti continu reject brice advanc bench attitud brice decri favorit coach tower raymond g mose local paper alterc coach locker room brice shout hell corp quit team huff caus scandal among cadet move cadet honor committe silenc brice brice roommat tex mcneil william bakewel tri reason anger brice hit immedi regret action brice tri help brice leav contempl action privat tex accident fall flight stair despit plead honor committe censur brice—befor collaps seriou concuss brice write letter resign west point shame regret action realiz need help team train carri team armynavi game leav brice call superintend indic contrit understand spirit corp superintend hand back resign brice apolog coach behavior still bench 4th quarter armi player injur brice sent despit injur arm score touchdown win game armi ask forgiv team graduat west point conclud year later end arm betti enthusiast observ tradit corp

1928,While the City Sleeps,American,Jack Conway,"Lon Chaney, Anita Page",crime drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_the_City_Sleeps_(1928_film),"The film focuses on the 'Plain Clothes Men', a group of detectives dressed up as average citizens to catch criminals without being noticed. They are especially hated by the underworld due to their constant meeting, during which suspects are analyzed and interrogated extensively. Among the staff is Dan Coghlan (Lon Chaney), a police officer with flat feet and a tough disposition, who is unsatisfied with the lack of adventure. As he is about to quit his job, he is noticed about a croaked jeweler. When arriving there, he finds Skeeter Carlson (Wheeler Oakman), a crook who never gets busted for a crime due to a lack of evidence.
Dan decides to follow him, and after talking to Skeeter's low-life girlfriend Bessie (Mae Busch) without gaining any information, he prevents Skeeter from seducing Myrtle Sullivan (Anita Page), an innocent flapper who finds excitement in hanging out with crooks. Dan has lately assigned himself as Myrtle's care-taker, and he disapproves of her boyfriend Marty (Carroll Nye), a dapper gangster without a job. When Skeeter is out of town for two days, Dan graps this opportunity to manipulate Bessie. After convincing her that Skeeter will soon dump her for Myrtle, Bessie admits that he croaked the jeweler.
Without wasting any time, Dan sets out to bust Skeeter and his men, only to find out that one of them is Marty. Shortly after, Bessie's body is found, and Dan is convinced that Skeeter is responsible for her death, considering that she was going to testify against him. The case against Skeeter is dismissed by the court, and he immediately reveals his plans on murdering Marty. Dan overhears this conversation, and hurries to Marty for protection, only to catch him in the midst of a robbery. Even though he is able to turn him in, Dan orders the police to leave Marty alone and helps him to take his first, tentative steps on the straight path.
Before leaving town, Marty wants to meet Myrtle one more time and sends her a letter, but Skeeter reads it before she can. He forces himself up to her, but is disturbed by police raid. Before they open the door, Skeeter fires a shot through it - which croaks a cop - and gets away. Upon finding out that she will testify against him, Skeeter sets out to kill her. Meanwhile, Dan tells Myrtle against better judgment that he loves her and then proposes to her. Even though she is actually in love with Marty, Myrtle accepts, mostly out of gratitude for all that Dan has done for her.
Afterwards, Dan leaves to find Skeeter, and catches him and his men preparing for a get-away. It results in a giant shootout, during which several policemen and gangsters are killed. Skeeter's men give in after being attacked by tear bombs, but Skeeter finds a way to escape to the rooftop. Dan follows him there, and after another shootout, Skeeter is killed. Meanwhile, Marty returns to town in rage after finding out about Dan and Myrtle's engagement. He proposes to Myrtle, but she decides to stay loyal to Dan. Dan realizes that she loves Marty, and allows them to be together.",film focus plain cloth men group detect dress averag citizen catch crimin without notic especi hate underworld due constant meet suspect analyz interrog extens among staff dan coghlan lon chaney polic offic flat feet tough disposit unsatisfi lack adventur quit job notic croak jewel arriv find skeeter carlson wheeler oakman crook never get bust crime due lack evid dan decid follow talk skeeter lowlif girlfriend bessi mae busch without gain inform prevent skeeter seduc myrtl sullivan anita page innoc flapper find excit hang crook dan late assign myrtl caretak disapprov boyfriend marti carrol nye dapper gangster without job skeeter town two day dan grap opportun manipul bessi convinc skeeter soon dump myrtl bessi admit croak jewel without wast time dan set bust skeeter men find one marti shortli bessi bodi found dan convinc skeeter respons death consid go testifi case skeeter dismiss court immedi reveal plan murder marti dan overhear convers hurri marti protect catch midst robberi even though abl turn dan order polic leav marti alon help take first tent step straight path leav town marti want meet myrtl one time send letter skeeter read forc disturb polic raid open door skeeter fire shot croak cop get away upon find testifi skeeter set kill meanwhil dan tell myrtl better judgment love propos even though actual love marti myrtl accept mostli gratitud dan done afterward dan leav find skeeter catch men prepar getaway result giant shootout sever policemen gangster kill skeeter men give attack tear bomb skeeter find way escap rooftop dan follow anoth shootout skeeter kill meanwhil marti return town rage find dan myrtl engag propos myrtl decid stay loyal dan dan realiz love marti allow togeth

1928,The Wind,American,Victor Sjöström,"Lillian Gish, Lars Hanson",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_(1928_film),"An impoverished young woman named Letty Mason (Lillian Gish) travels west by train from Virginia to live at her cousin Beverly's isolated ranch in Sweetwater, Texas. On the way, she is bothered by the constantly blowing wind. Fellow passenger and cattle buyer Wirt Roddy (Montagu Love) makes her acquaintance and tells her the wind usually drives women crazy.
Upon arrival, she is picked up by Beverly's closest neighbors, Lige Hightower (Lars Hanson) and the older, balding Sourdough (William Orlamond), who live 15 miles from her cousin. Wirt assures her he will drop by occasionally to see how she is doing.
After endless miles in sand and wind, they arrive at the ranch. Beverly (Edward Earle) is delighted to see her, but his jealous wife Cora (Dorothy Cumming) gives her a cold reception, despite Letty saying she and Beverly (who was raised by Letty's mother) are like brother and sister. Cora is further angered when her children seem to like Letty better.
At a party, Sourdough tells Lige that he intends proposing to Letty. Lige explains he was planning to do the same. After Wirt drops by, a cyclone interrupts the festivities. Most of the guests seek shelter in the basement, where Wirt declares his love for Letty and offers to take her away from the dismal place. After the cyclone passes, Lige and Sourdough talk to Letty in private. When they flip a coin to see who will ask for her hand in marriage (Lige wins), Letty thinks it is just a joke.
Afterward, Cora demands that she leave Beverly alone and that she has to leave the ranch. Because she has neither money nor a place to go, she decides to go away with Wirt, but then Wirt reveals that he wants her for a mistress, informing her that he already has a wife. She goes back to Cora, who tells her to choose from her two other suitors. She marries Lige.
When Lige takes her home, he kisses Letty for the first time, but her lack of enthusiasm is unmistakable. Worse for the drink, he becomes more forceful, and this makes her tell him that he has made her hate him, which she did not want to do. Lige promises her he will never touch her. He states he will try to make enough money to send her back to Virginia. In the meantime, Letty works around the house, but is bothered by the ever present wind.
One day, Lige is invited to a meeting of the cattlemen, who must do something to avoid starvation. Letty, terrified of being left alone with only the wind for company, begs to go with him. He agrees. After she cannot control her horse in the fierce wind, he has her get on behind him on his horse. When she falls off, Lige tells Sourdough to take her home.
When the cattlemen return, they bring an unwanted guest, an injured Wirt. After he recovers, Lige insists he participate in a roundup of wild horses to raise money for the cattlemen. Wirt goes along, but later sneaks away and returns to Letty. Out of her mind with fear as she endures the house shaking from the worst wind storm yet, Letty faints soon after Wirt's arrival. He picks her up and carries her to the bed.[note 1]
The next morning, Wirt tries to persuade Letty to go away with him, but she rejects him. He insists, noting Lige will kill them both if they remain. As Wirt becomes more aggressive, Letty picks up a revolver to defend herself. Confident that Letty will not fire, Wirt grabs the gun and it goes off, killing him. Letty decides to bury him outside. After she is done, the wind uncovers the body, terrifying her.
When Lige returns, Letty is so glad to see him, she kisses her husband. She then confesses she killed and buried Wirt. When Lige looks outside, however, the corpse is nowhere to be seen. He tells Letty that the wind can remove traces when a killing is justified. He has enough money to send her away, but Letty declares she loves him and that she no longer wants to leave. She is no longer afraid of the wind.",impoverish young woman name letti mason lillian gish travel west train virginia live cousin beverli isol ranch sweetwat texa way bother constantli blow wind fellow passeng cattl buyer wirt roddi montagu love make acquaint tell wind usual drive women crazi upon arriv pick beverli closest neighbor lige hightow lar hanson older bald sourdough william orlamond live 15 mile cousin wirt assur drop occasion see endless mile sand wind arriv ranch beverli edward earl delight see jealou wife cora dorothi cum give cold recept despit letti say beverli rais letti mother like brother sister cora anger children seem like letti better parti sourdough tell lige intend propos letti lige explain plan wirt drop cyclon interrupt festiv guest seek shelter basement wirt declar love letti offer take away dismal place cyclon pass lige sourdough talk letti privat flip coin see ask hand marriag lige win letti think joke afterward cora demand leav beverli alon leav ranch neither money place go decid go away wirt wirt reveal want mistress inform alreadi wife goe back cora tell choos two suitor marri lige lige take home kiss letti first time lack enthusiasm unmistak wors drink becom forc make tell made hate want lige promis never touch state tri make enough money send back virginia meantim letti work around hous bother ever present wind one day lige invit meet cattlemen must someth avoid starvat letti terrifi left alon wind compani beg go agre control hors fierc wind get behind hors fall lige tell sourdough take home cattlemen return bring unwant guest injur wirt recov lige insist particip roundup wild hors rais money cattlemen wirt goe along later sneak away return letti mind fear endur hous shake worst wind storm yet letti faint soon wirt arriv pick carri bednot 1 next morn wirt tri persuad letti go away reject insist note lige kill remain wirt becom aggress letti pick revolv defend confid letti fire wirt grab gun goe kill letti decid buri outsid done wind uncov bodi terrifi lige return letti glad see kiss husband confess kill buri wirt lige look outsid howev corps nowher seen tell letti wind remov trace kill justifi enough money send away letti declar love longer want leav longer afraid wind

1929,Applause,American,Rouben Mamoulian,"Helen Morgan, Joan Peers",musical,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applause_(1929_film),"The first scene has a marching band playing Theodore Mentz's ""A Hot Time in the Old Town"".
The film tells of Kitty Darling (Helen Morgan), a burlesque star, who sends her young daughter to a convent to get her away from the sleazy burlesque environment she is involved in.
Many years later, Kitty is not doing so well and her best days are behind her. She's now an alcoholic who lives in the past. She lives with a burlesque comic named Hitch (Fuller Mellish Jr.). Hitch cheats on her and only cares about spending what little money she has. When he finds out she has been paying for her daughter's convent education for over a decade, he pushes her into bringing April back home.
Her grown, but naive daughter April (Joan Peers) returns. Kitty is embarrassed by her condition and marries Hitch so that April will not be ashamed of her.
When April arrives, she is disgusted with her mother and her sad life. Hitch tries to force her into show business and repeatedly gropes her, at one point forcing a kiss on her.
April roams the city and meets a lonely young sailor named Tony (Henry Wadsworth). They fall in love and agree to marry and April will move to his home in Wisconsin. When April goes to tell her mother about their plans she overhears Hitch belittling Kitty, calling her a ""has-been.""
April is upset and calls off her wedding. She decides to join the chorus line of a burlesque show. She says a reluctant goodbye to Tony at the subway. Meanwhile, Kitty takes an overdose of sleeping pills. The bottle clearly says ""For insomnia one tablet only"". She goes downstairs to the show and collapses on a couch.
Knowing that Kitty cannot perform in the show, the producer berates her, mistaking her reaction to the overdose for delirium tremens. April, also not realizing what is happening, and over Kitty's objections, says she will take Kitty's place. She tells Kitty she will take care of her now, like Kitty always did for April. As April goes onstage, Kitty passes away, her head hanging over the edge of the couch.
April is disgusted at herself and cannot complete the show. As she runs off the stage, none other than Tony is there to greet her. He says he had a feeling she did not mean what she was saying. She hugs him close and says she wants to go far away. Not realizing Kitty is dead, she says they will need to take care of her mother too, and Tony agrees.

1929,The Broadway Melody,American,Harry Beaumont,"Charles King, Anita Page, Bessie Love.",musical comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Broadway_Melody,"Eddie Kearns (Charles King) sings ""The Broadway Melody"", and tells some chorus girls that he brought the Mahoney Sisters vaudeville act to New York to perform it with him in the latest revue being produced by Francis Zanfield (Eddie Kane). Harriet ""Hank"" Mahoney (Bessie Love) and her sister Queenie Mahoney (Anita Page) are awaiting Eddie's arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. Hank declines the offer of their Uncle Jed (Jed Prouty) to join a 30-week traveling show but consents to think it over.
Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield's revue to present their act. A blond woman sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank. Zanfield isn't interested in it, but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well, saying both will work for one wage. She also convinces him to pretend that Hank's business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During a dress rehearsal for the revue, Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for ""The Broadway Melody"" and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another woman is injured after falling off a set prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques ""Jock"" Warriner (Kenneth Thomson). While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.
Over the following weeks, Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and the deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight her growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she's setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other, but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister's heart, runs off to Jock once again.
Hank, after witnessing Queenie's fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes that they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she'd only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves, she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.
There's a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie, but he insists that they spend time alone. When she resists his advances, he says that it's the least that she could do after all he's done for her. He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.
Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the return of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend, but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she's through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank live with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that she wasn't able to help her sister find the happiness she deserves. Ironically, Hank's new partner is the blond who tried to sabotage the act when the sisters first arrived in New York. The final scene shows Hank on her way to the train station.

One of the many replies intrigues him: Phyllis Benton claims she is in great danger. He immediately sets out for the Green Bay Inn, where she has reserved some rooms for him. Unable to persuade him to give up this mad adventure, his friend Algy Longworth follows after, dragging Drummond's valet, Danny, along.
Phyllis turns out to be all Drummond had hoped for: beautiful and desperately in need of help. Her wealthy uncle, John Travers, is being treated in a hospital by a Dr. Lakington for a nervous breakdown, but she is sure there is something wrong about the hospital and Dr. Lakington, and that she is being watched constantly. She runs away when she spots the outline of two eavesdropping men (Algy and Danny), much to Drummond's annoyance. She is caught and taken to Dr. Lakington's Nursing Home by Carl Peterson, Irma and the doctor.
When Drummond follows, he witnesses Travers' unsuccessful attempt to escape. Drummond drives away, but returns stealthily and rescues Phyllis. Sending her off with Algy and Danny, he sneaks back once more and overhears Irma convince the others to stay and try to get Travers' signature on a document transferring securities and jewels to them. Drummond manages to save Travers.
However, he makes a serious error when he takes Travers back to the inn. The villains soon arrive there. Drummond manages to disguise himself as Travers; the crooks take him back, along with Phyllis. When they realise they have the wrong man they threaten to torture Phyllis. Drummond tells them Travers is hidden at the inn (whereas he is really being driven to London). While Peterson and Irma go to check, Drummond is freed by Phyllis before Lakington can kill him. He strangles the doctor.

Fortunately, Jimmy has regained his senses and reconciled with Alyce LaFosse. However, the Canary is determined to force Jimmy to marry her so she can join the social elite, threatening to reveal that Jimmy was embezzling from his father. She turns down the elder Spotswoode's offer of money to leave Jimmy alone. She also telephones two men she has been blackmailing, Cleaver and Mannix, and demands one final generous gift from each of them by the next day. She also informs ""creepy"" admirer Dr. Lindquist. Her ex-husband Tony Sheel eavesdrops and wants half, but she refuses to give him anything, even after he hits her. Cleaver, Mannix and Lindquist are all shown lurking about her apartment building late that night.
Spotswoode visits her at her apartment around midnight, but cannot get her to change her mind. After he reaches the lobby of her building, he and another person hear screams from her place. They knock on the door, but she assures them that she is fine.
The next day, she is found strangled to death. The coroner places the time of death around midnight. District Attorney Markham investigates, aided by Philo Vance (a close friend of Charles Spotswoode) and Police Sergeant Heath. After all the prime suspects are questioned, Vance asks Markham to keep them waiting for a few hours. Markham agrees, as Vance has helped solve another case. Vance subtly maneuvers Cleaver, Mannix, Lindquist and the two Spotswoodes into playing poker to pass the time so he can observe their personality traits. Only one shows the daring, imagination and discipline required for the crime; that man bluffs Vance, betting everything with just a pair of deuces. The suspects are then released.
Sheel, who was hiding in the closet, and witnessed the murder, sends the killer several blackmail letters. For his trouble, he too is strangled. A pen found at the scene has Jimmy's name on it, so Heath arrests him for the murder. Jimmy then confesses to both murders, but Vance knows better.
He telephones Charles Spotswoode with the news and suggests they meet in an hour. Spotswoode speeds to the city from his country estate to confess, but his chauffeur makes a fatal mistake by trying to beat a train to a crossing, and Spotswoode is killed. Now Vance has to show how he murdered the Canary in order to free Jimmy. Fortunately, he is able to figure out that the Canary was dead before Spotswoode left her apartment that night. Spotswoode had made a recording (Vance speculates it was Spotswoode himself pretending to be the woman) to fool a stuttering witness into believing she was alive and well.

Their dashing, daredevil leader is the mysterious ""Red Shadow"". Margot Bonvalet, a lovely, sassy French girl, is soon to be married at the fort to Birabeau's right-hand man, Captain Fontaine. Birabeau's son Pierre, in reality the Red Shadow, loves Margot, but pretends to be a milksop to preserve his secret identity. Margot tells Pierre that she secretly yearns to be swept into the arms of some bold, dashing sheik, perhaps even the Red Shadow himself. Pierre, as the Red Shadow, kidnaps Margot and declares his love for her.
To her surprise, Margot's mysterious abductor treats her with every Western consideration. When the Red Shadow comes face to face with General Birabeau, the old man challenges the rebel leader to a duel. Of course Pierre will not kill his own father, so he refuses to fight, losing the respect of the Riffs. Azuri, the sinuous and secretive native dancing girl, might be persuaded to answer some of these riddles if only she can be persuaded by Captain Fontaine. Meanwhile, two other characters, Benny (a reporter) and Susan provide comic relief. Eventually, the Red Shadow's identity is discovered, a deal is struck with the Riffs, and Pierre and Margot live happily ever after.

1929,Disraeli,American,Alfred E. Green,"George Arliss, Joan Bennett",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disraeli_(1929_film),"In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker.
Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase.
But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters.
Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa.
Disraeli is elated when he receives the news. However, Myers comes and informs him that his banking house has been driven into bankruptcy by sabotage; the cheque is worthless. Disraeli tells him to keep his situation secret for the moment. When the prying Mrs. Travers arrives, Disraeli allows her to learn of the purchase, and she exultantly admits to her key part in sabotaging Myers.
Thinking quickly, Disraeli summons Probert. Though the banker initially refuses to help, Disraeli forces him to sign a paper giving unlimited credit to Myers by threatening to have Parliament revoke the bank's charter. (After Probert leaves, Disraeli confesses to his wife and Clarissa that he was bluffing.) Myers' solvency is restored, the deal is completed, and as a result of Disraeli's success, Queen Victoria can add Empress of India to her other titles.",1874 disra ambiti foreign polici aim creat british empir vote hous common speech great rival william gladston later disra receiv welcom news spendthrift khediv egypt dire need money will sell control share suez canal purchas canal would secur control india michael probert head bank england make clear disra vehement oppos plan disra summon hugh myer lead jewish banker meanwhil lord charl deeford propos ladi clarissa pevensey although love turn content enjoy wealth high social stand lack ambit want husband great admir prime minist charl strong opinion disra see promis young man want clarissa happi convinc charl come work tell canal purchas tell spi russia eager seiz india assign two spi watch disra mr traver entre highest social circl mr foljamb disra fool hire foljamb person govern secretari better deceiv foljamb ask charl myer provid financi back purchas canal charl say noth manner make clear foljamb guess correctli mr traver order foljamb leav countri warn master disra soon discov happen decid send agent khediv immedi clarissa suggest send charl charl persuad khediv accept myer chequ exchang share also prove worth clarissa disra elat receiv news howev myer come inform bank hous driven bankruptci sabotag chequ worthless disra tell keep situat secret moment pri mr traver arriv disra allow learn purchas exultantli admit key part sabotag myer think quickli disra summon probert though banker initi refus help disra forc sign paper give unlimit credit myer threaten parliament revok bank charter probert leav disra confess wife clarissa bluf myer solvenc restor deal complet result disra success queen victoria add empress india titl

His only concern is for his young sister Katie (Muriel McCormac), who will be left all alone. Frivolous socialite Cynthia Crothers (Kay Johnson) has her own troubles. By the terms of her grandfather's will, if she is not married by her twenty-third birthday (only a month away), she will not inherit his millions and will be left penniless. She is ""engaged"" to Roger Towne (Conrad Nagel), but he is married to Marcia (Julia Faye). Marcia has her own lover, Marco (Joel McCrea), and is willing to grant Roger a divorce ... for the right price. The two women haggle behind Roger's back and settle on $100,000.
Hagon, desperate to provide for Katie, offers his body for $10,000 in a newspaper ad. Cynthia sees it and goes to see him. She offers him the money in exchange for him marrying her. He accepts. Just minutes before Hagon's execution though, the real killer is goaded into attacking a man with a gun and is fatally shot. He confesses before dying, and Hagon is released.
Hagon goes to see his stunned wife. When her friends show up to party the night away, he sees Cynthia writing a $25,000 check as down payment to Marcia and discussing the terms of their agreement. In a confrontation between the group, Hagon grabs the check stashed in Marcia's garter, showing it to Roger as proof that he's been made a pawn. Roger tells Cynthia that he will settle with Marcia himself but if Cynthia gives her the check, they're through. Cynthia rips up the check as Marcia threatens to expose the plot. The pair go downstairs where Cynthia reveals to the party happening that she married another man. Hagon reveals himself as her husband and the party devolves into a crude mockery of the marriage, bringing reality to Cynthia's fear of being made a laughingstock. Having had enough, Hagon throws out the partygoers which frightens the men and arouses the women. Cynthia shows little appreciation for the act of saving her from the mockery and locks herself in her room. Hagon resolves to return her money and breaks down her door to speak to her. After a brief confrontation, Hagon flings $10,000 at her and leaves.
When Cynthia is informed that she must actually be living with her husband on her birthday, she drives to his mining town. He refuses to go back to her palatial apartment, so she persuades him to let her stay with him. He agrees on condition that she cook and clean, just like a real wife, and locks up her fancy car in his tool shed. Her first attempt at preparing a meal is a dismal failure. Katie kindly helps out and keeps it a secret from Hagon, but Cynthia confesses on her own. Hagon tells her it is the first honest thing he has seen her do.
The next day, while shopping at the local store, Cynthia buys a gift for a young boy. His mother objects, but the child runs away with his present and is hurt in a traffic accident. The doctor says that only a brain specialist in the city can save him, but the boy only has hours to live. Cynthia breaks into the tool shed, speeds away in her car and returns with the specialist. The child is saved.
Hagon returns from work to find the door of his tool shed demolished and learns that Cynthia withdrew $2,000 from the bank (to pay the specialist). He assumes that she got tired of his way of life and went to see Roger. When Hagon demands an explanation, Cynthia is too disheartened to reply. She telephones Roger to come for her. However, the child's mother tells Hagon what Cynthia has done.
When Roger shows up, he insists on seeing Hagon before leaving. They go down into the bowels of the mine to find him. A cave-in traps the trio with only fifteen minutes worth of air. Hagon finally confesses he loves Cynthia. Then he realizes there is a way out. He quickly packs a stick of dynamite into a wall; there is another chamber on the other side with enough air to sustain them until they can be rescued. However, without a fuse cap, someone will have to strike the dynamite with a sledgehammer to set it off. After arguing, the two men toss a coin for the privilege. Roger ""wins"", but Hagon wrestles the sledgehammer away from him. After Cynthia whispers something to Roger, he tells Hagon that Cynthia loves Roger wants to say goodbye to him. When Hagon goes to Cynthia, he asks her to get on with saying what she needs to say. Confused, she reveals that she said she loves Hagon. With the two safely out of the way, Roger sets off the dynamite and is blown to pieces.",coal miner hagon derk charl bickford sentenc hang murder concern young sister kati muriel mccormac left alon frivol socialit cynthia crother kay johnson troubl term grandfath marri twentythird birthday month away inherit million left penniless engag roger town conrad nagel marri marcia julia fay marcia lover marco joel mccrea will grant roger divorc right price two women haggl behind roger back settl 100000 hagon desper provid kati offer bodi 10000 newspap ad cynthia see goe see offer money exchang marri accept minut hagon execut though real killer goad attack man gun fatal shot confess die hagon releas hagon goe see stun wife friend show parti night away see cynthia write 25000 check payment marcia discuss term agreement confront group hagon grab check stash marcia garter show roger proof he made pawn roger tell cynthia settl marcia cynthia give check theyr cynthia rip check marcia threaten expos plot pair go downstair cynthia reveal parti happen marri anoth man hagon reveal husband parti devolv crude mockeri marriag bring realiti cynthia fear made laughingstock enough hagon throw partygo frighten men arous women cynthia show littl appreci act save mockeri lock room hagon resolv return money break door speak brief confront hagon fling 10000 leav cynthia inform must actual live husband birthday drive mine town refus go back palati apart persuad let stay agre condit cook clean like real wife lock fanci car tool shed first attempt prepar meal dismal failur kati kindli help keep secret hagon cynthia confess hagon tell first honest thing seen next day shop local store cynthia buy gift young boy mother object child run away present hurt traffic accid doctor say brain specialist citi save boy hour live cynthia break tool shed speed away car return specialist child save hagon return work find door tool shed demolish learn cynthia withdrew 2000 bank pay specialist assum got tire way life went see roger hagon demand explan cynthia dishearten repli telephon roger come howev child mother tell hagon cynthia done roger show insist see hagon leav go bowel mine find cavein trap trio fifteen minut worth air hagon final confess love cynthia realiz way quickli pack stick dynamit wall anoth chamber side enough air sustain rescu howev without fuse cap someon strike dynamit sledgehamm set argu two men toss coin privileg roger win hagon wrestl sledgehamm away cynthia whisper someth roger tell hagon cynthia love roger want say goodby hagon goe cynthia ask get say need say confus reveal said love hagon two safe way roger set dynamit blown piec

The mischievous Pia (Mona Rico) throws herself at Marcus, but she is also rejected. Marcus and Ciglia profess their love, while the jealous and vindictive Pia looks on.
Following the end of the French Army occupation, the people of Pontresina celebrate their liberation with a boisterous masked dance. At the party Ciglia becomes frightened of a drunken Marcus and she asks to be taken home. Marcus goes home confused. When Pia boldly attempts to seduce Marcus, he accepts her advances. The next day Ciglia receives permission from her uncle Tass (Hobart Bosworth) to marry Marcus. Pia and her mother approach Tass, and then confront Marcus. With Ciglia overhearing, they demand that Marcus marry Pia, who plays the cowering innocent. Ciglia leaves Marcus, and Marcus and Pia get married. Lorenz soon takes advantage of Ciglia and eventually they also get married.
During a heavy snowstorm, Pia is worried about Marcus and tries to form a rescue party to find him. With no one willing to join, she turns to Lorenz and Ciglia. Ciglia overreacts to the news, making Lorenz suspicious about her affections. Ciglia soon discovers Marcus safely arriving in the village. Consumed in jealously and sorrow, Lorenz confronts Marcus, urging him to leave the village, even offering him money, but Marcus refuses.
Later in the mountains, Lorenz ambushes Marcus and the two exchange gunfire. Marcus returns to the village, followed by the accusing and dying Lorenz. The villagers turn against Marcus despite Ciglia's cries of his innocence. Pia falsely accuses Ciglia of putting Marcus up to the murder of Lorenz.

After being treated decently by gruff U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant ""Panama"" Williams (Jack Holt), a spectator, Phelps decides to enlist in the Marines himself. He is selected to attend pilot training school at Naval Air Station Pensacola, where Williams is a flying instructor. When Williams finally recognizes Lefty, he befriends him and takes him under his wing. On his first attempt at solo flight, however, Lefty is taunted about the football game by fellow recruit Steve Roberts (Harold Goodwin), and cannot take off, resulting in a crash. Panama rescues Lefty from the burning aircraft, suffering burns to his hands. Lefty is ""washed out"" by his squadron commander, Major Rowell (Alan Roscoe).
Lefty is taken to the base hospital, where he falls for Navy nurse Elinor Murray (Lila Lee). When the ""Flying Devils"" squadron is sent to quell bandit attacks by the notorious General Lobo in Nicaragua, Panama arranges for Lefty to accompany him as his mechanic. Panama shows Lefty a photograph of Elinor, the love of his life, not knowing Lefty is in love with her too. When Elinor is sent to Nicaragua, she does not understand the guilt-stricken Lefty's cool reception. When the girl-shy Panama asks Lefty to propose to Elinor on his behalf, Elinor confesses her love for him instead, after which Panama accuses Lefty of betrayal.
An urgent call for help by a Marine outpost under bandit attack stops any confrontation. Lefty flies as gunner for Steve Roberts, who makes fun of him about shooting in the right direction. During the mission, their aircraft is shot down in a swamp. Unwilling to join in the rescue, Panama reports in sick, but once Elinor convinces him that Lefty never betrayed him, he flies his own solo rescue mission. At the crash site, Roberts dies of his injuries and is cremated by Lefty using their aircraft as a funeral pyre. Panama finds Lefty but is wounded by bandits led by General Lobo, after his landing. Lefty kills the attacking bandits, takes off, and brings the pair back, putting on an impressive flying display over the base that includes safely landing the aircraft after it loses a wheel. Sometime later, Lefty has won his wings and is now an instructor at the school, married to Elinor.

They all hope to become aviators. When the officer of the day becomes sick, Tommy Winslow (Ramon Navarro) has to take his place, while the others go out and celebrate. Two return loudly drunk after curfew. Tommy is able to shut Steve (Ralph Graves) up (by knocking him out), but ""Dizzy"" is not so lucky. An officer hears him and has him dismissed from the Academy.
The rest spend a year in the fleet, then reunite in San Diego for aviation training. Upon their arrival, they become acquainted with the beautiful Anita Hastings (Anita Page). Tommy and Steve become rivals for her affections.
Specs is rejected for training because of his bad eyesight. The remaining four then head to training school in Pensacola, Florida. Kewpie panics on his first flight, forcing his instructor to knock him out to regain control of their trainer biplane, while ""Tex"" loses control during his first solo flight and crashes into the sea. Tommy and Steve pass and are promoted to lieutenant. Upon their return to San Diego, they are reunited with Specs, now an aerial navigator, and Kewpie, the radio officer of the USS Langley, the Navy's first aircraft carrier.
The romantic rivalry between Tommy and Steve takes an ugly turn when it becomes apparent that Anita prefers Tommy. Steve resorts to underhanded tricks, straining his friendship with Tommy. In retaliation for Steve hiding his uniform pants during a swimming outing with Anita, Tommy buzzes Steve on the airfield after a mock aerial dogfight he has won. The admiral is greatly displeased, and deprives Tommy of the honor of piloting a pioneering 2,500-mile (4,000 km) flight to Honolulu, awarding it to Steve instead.
Steve takes off, with Specs as his navigator. However, they run into a severe storm and crash into the ocean before the radio operator can report their position. All four of the crew survive and make it to the floating aircraft wing, but Specs is badly injured. The admiral, following in the Langley aircraft carrier, immediately orders an all-out aerial search. As the days go by, Steve and the others save the little fresh water for Specs, despite his protests; finally, while the others are asleep, Specs drags himself into the water and drowns himself. Meanwhile, the admiral is ordered to give up his fruitless search. Tommy pleads with him for one last attempt, and the admiral agrees. Tommy finally spots the survivors, but his engine conks out. He sets his aircraft on fire as a signal to the Langley and parachutes into the water.

1929,Gold Diggers of Broadway,American,Roy Del Ruth,"Nancy Welford, Conway Tearle",musical comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Diggers_of_Broadway_(film),"The film opens on an audience watching a lavish 1929 Broadway show, featuring a giant gold mine production number (""Song of the Gold Diggers""). Famous guitarist Nick Lucas sings ""Painting the Clouds with Sunshine"", which climaxes on stage with a huge art deco revolving sun.
Backstage, the star of the show (Ann Pennington) fights over Nick with another girl. Also introduced are a group of chorus girls who are 'man hungry'. They are all looking for love and money, but are not sure which is the more important. They are visited by a faded star who is reduced to selling cosmetic soap. They gossip about how they all want a man with plenty of money, so they do not end up the same way.
Businessman Stephen Lee (Conway Tearle) angrily forbids his nephew Wally (William Bakewell) to marry Violet, one of the showgirls. A corpulent lawyer friend, Blake (Albert Gran), advises him to befriend the showgirl first before making a decision. The showgirls are friends who stick together, and the most raucous girl called Mabel (Winnie Lightner) takes a fancy to Blake, calling him 'sweetie' and showing her appreciation by singing him a song (""Mechanical Man"").
That evening, they all visit a huge nightclub. Mabel ends up on a table singing another song to Blake, ""Wolf from the Door"", before jumping into his lap. Showgirl Jerry (Nancy Welford) moves the party to her apartment. Everyone gets drunk and after seeing Ann Pennington dance on the kitchen table, Lee decides he is 'getting to like these showgirls'. Blake says he is 'losing his mind or just plain mad'. Keeping the fun going, Lucas sings ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"". Complications come thick and fast after a balloon game, with both Blake and Lee falling under the spell of Mabel and Jerry. The party ends with Lucas singing ""Go to Bed"" and Jerry contriving to get Lee back after everyone has left. She gets him more drunk whilst tipping her own drinks away when he is not looking. Her aim is to get Lee to agree to allow Wally to marry. To do this, she lies and is shown up by her own mother, who accidentally finds them together.
Next morning, Jerry feels disgraced. Mabel has been given an extra line for the show ""I am the spirit of the ages and the progress of civilisation"", but cannot get the words right. Lucas is told off for singing poor songs and sings another ""What will I do without you"". Ann Pennington fights with another showgirl and hurts her eye. Jerry is asked to take her place as the star of the evening performance. Mabel receives a proposal of marriage from Blake, but worries about her extra line.
The show starts with Nick Lucas reprising ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips""' with full orchestra in a huge stage set that shows girl tulips in a huge greenhouse. Backstage, Uncle Steve comes back to give his consent to his nephew and to tell Jerry he wants to marry her.
The finale starts with Jerry leading the ""Song of the Gold Diggers"" against a huge art deco backdrop of Paris at night.

1929,The Great Gabbo,American,James Cruze,"Erich von Stroheim, Betty Compson",musical comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gabbo,"The movie follows brilliant ventriloquist ""The Great Gabbo"" (Stroheim), who increasingly uses his dummy ""Otto"" as his only means of self-expression—an artist driven insane by his work.
Gabbo's gimmick is his astonishing ability to make Otto talk—and even sing—while Gabbo himself smokes, drinks and eats. Gabbo's girlfriend and assistant Mary (Betty Compson) loves him, but is driven to leave him by his megalomania, superstitions, irritability, and inability to express any human emotion without using Otto as an intermediary. In Otto's voice Gabbo accepts the blame for Mary's leaving and recounts all the things she did for him, but as Gabbo he denies his feelings and tells the dummy to shut up.
Two years later, Gabbo has become a nationally renowned ventriloquist. He is revered for his talent even as he is ridiculed for his eccentricity: he takes Otto with him everywhere he goes, even dining out with him, providing much entertainment to the restaurant patrons. Despite his success he continues to pine for Mary, who is now romantically involved with another singer/dancer, Frank (Donald Douglas). With both Mary and Frank performing in a show in which Gabbo is the headliner, he attempts to win her back. Mary is charmed by Gabbo's new romantic behavior, driving Frank to angry fits of jealousy. As his courtship meets with continued success, Gabbo increasingly expresses his emotions to Mary directly, without using Otto.
One day Gabbo finds that in his absence, Mary has straightened up his dressing room the way she always used to. Convinced that she wants to come back to him, he confronts her with his feelings, admitting his loneliness without her and in the process revealing that he has grown past many of his old failings, such as his superstitions and obsession with his personal success. However, Mary tells him that she loves Frank, and has been married to him since before Gabbo came back into her life. She says that she missed Otto but not Gabbo, and in a last farewell she says ""I love you"" to Otto.
In profound frustration at this, after Mary is gone Gabbo punches Otto in the face, but immediately apologizes and embraces the dummy, weeping. He then storms onto the stage during the finale and loudly rants at the performers. He is forced off the stage and fired from the show. Mary tries to confront Gabbo afterwards, but he only looks at her sadly and walks away. The film ends with workers taking down the letters of ""The Great Gabbo"" from the marquee as Gabbo looks on.",movi follow brilliant ventriloquist great gabbo stroheim increasingli use dummi otto mean selfexpression—an artist driven insan work gabbo gimmick astonish abil make otto talk—and even sing—whil gabbo smoke drink eat gabbo girlfriend assist mari betti compson love driven leav megalomania superstit irrit inabl express human emot without use otto intermediari otto voic gabbo accept blame mari leav recount thing gabbo deni feel tell dummi shut two year later gabbo becom nation renown ventriloquist rever talent even ridicul eccentr take otto everywher goe even dine provid much entertain restaur patron despit success continu pine mari romant involv anoth singerdanc frank donald dougla mari frank perform show gabbo headlin attempt win back mari charm gabbo new romant behavior drive frank angri fit jealousi courtship meet continu success gabbo increasingli express emot mari directli without use otto one day gabbo find absenc mari straighten dress room way alway use convinc want come back confront feel admit loneli without process reveal grown past mani old fail superstit obsess person success howev mari tell love frank marri sinc gabbo came back life say miss otto gabbo last farewel say love otto profound frustrat mari gone gabbo punch otto face immedi apolog embrac dummi weep storm onto stage final loudli rant perform forc stage fire show mari tri confront gabbo afterward look sadli walk away film end worker take letter great gabbo marque gabbo look

When Tom learns of the meeting, he sends a telegram to Dick, forging that it is from Judy, cancelling the rendezvous. At the appointed time of the meeting, Stribbling shows up, instead of Dick. When Judy makes it clear she wants nothing to do with him, Stribbling attempts to force himself on her. In the ensuing struggle, Stribbling trips, falling out of Judy's window to his death.

He is informed that half-caste Henry Shoesmith, Jr. (Ramon Novarro) owns the largest plantation, but is rather indolent.
Meanwhile, Shoesmith is lolling around, while admirer Madge (Renée Adorée), wishes she had met him before she became a fallen woman. Then the young man hears a woman singing aboard a ship. He swims out and is strongly attracted to Tito (Dorothy Janis). She, however, rebuffs him.
When the narrow-minded Slater first meets Shoesmith, he is quite rude to the native, but soon changes his manner when he learns who the young man is. The easygoing Shoesmith does not take offense, and is delighted to be formally introduced to Tito, Slater's half-caste ward. Slater starts to bargain for copra and is pleasantly surprised when Shoesmith offers him as much as he wants for free. He takes the precaution of having Shoesmith sign a contract to that effect.
Tito eventually falls in love with Shoesmith, but Slater has other plans for her. He tells Shoesmith to stay away from his ward, using the excuse that Shoesmith has no ambition. He suggests to the naive younger man that he take out a bank loan and build up his business. Then he sails away with Tito and his copra.
Shoesmith follows Slater's advice and runs a store, but Madge warns him he does not know what he is doing (he allows every customer to buy on credit). When Slater returns, Shoesmith asks Tito to marry him. She agrees. However, Slater informs the puzzled Shoesmith that the loan payments are overdue and that he is foreclosing on all of Shoesmith's property. In addition, Slater informs his ward that he will ""sacrifice"" himself to protect her by marrying her himself. Shoesmith is too late to stop the wedding, but while Madge distracts the guests, he carries Tito off to his native home.
Slater finds Tito while Shoesmith is away, takes her back to his ship and starts to beat her. Shoesmith follows, and a fight ensues. The younger man wins, and he and Tito swim back toward the island. However, when they spot approaching sharks, they have no choice but to head back to Slater, pursuing in his dinghy. Slater takes Tito aboard, but keeps his rival at bay with a sword.

After the wedding, Ned Levitt (Robert Woolsey), Chick's lawyer, informs Chick the divorce was invalid, and advises Wheeler to stay away from his bride.
The Wheeler-Woolsey plot is actually a subplot of the film, and the main story features Bebe Daniels (in her first ""talkie"") as Rita Ferguson, a south-of-the-border beauty pursued by both Texas Ranger Jim Stewart (John Boles) and local warlord General Ravenoff (Georges Renavent).

Meanwhile, Wheeler's first wife, Katie (Helen Kaiser), shows up to accuse him of bigamy, but conveniently falls in love with Woolsey.

1929,Seven Faces,American,Berthold Viertel,"Paul Muni, Marguerite Churchill",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Faces,"A common convention in the early decades of newspaper and magazine film reviews was to describe in the write-up the entire storyline including, in a substantial number of instances, the ending, thus unintentionally enabling subsequent generations of readers to reconstruct a lost film's contents. True to form, those who evaluated Seven Faces, such as Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times,[6] did go into considerable detail regarding plot twists, as related herein below.[7][8][9][10]
Papa Chibou (Paul Muni), the elderly caretaker of Musée Pratouchy, a Parisian wax museum, feels a strong kinship with the figures, particularly with that of Napoleon. He spots at the waxworks a romantic young couple, Georges (Russell Gleason), a lawyer, and Helene (Marguerite Churchill), the daughter of a stern judge (Lester Lonergan) who disapproves of his daughter's choice and forbids her to see Georges. Papa Chibou suggests to them that they can still stay in touch, without disobeying her father's directive not to speak with each other, by placing secret personal messages in the pockets of Napoleon's uniform. However, a missing letter and confusion in communication causes Georges to arrive at the mistaken conclusion that Helene has redirected her affections towards a foolish young man (Walter Rogers), who is unworthy of her and excessively preoccupied with his stylish personal appearance and elegant clothing.
Seeing their lovers' quarrel, Papa Chibou attempts to mollify the heated language, but George and Helene rebuff his soothing words by telling him not to interfere, since as an old man he knows nothing of love. Saddened by this rejection, he dreamily imagines that seven of the museum's waxworks come to life and offer philosophical advice on the intricacies of courtship and love. Don Juan, the legendary 17th century libertine, Napoleon (1769–1821),[11] Franz Schubert (1797–1828), African American boxer Joe Gans (1874–1910),[12] Willie Smith, a Cockney costermonger who became a music hall attraction after winning a lottery-auction known as Calcutta Sweepstakes[13] and a Parisian hypnotist whose purported mastery of dark arts earned him the stage name Diablero (all portrayed by Muni) as well as Catherine the Great (1729–1796) (portrayed by Salka Stenermann) speak to Papa Chibou, each in his or her own unique manner and accent, providing insight and personal experience in their reflections on this very intimate topic.[14][15]
The wax museum is unable to support itself and has to close. The owner, Monsieur Pratouchy (Gustav von Seyffertitz) puts the figures up for auction and Papa Chibou bids his life savings to acquire Napoleon, but is outbid. He then decides to take the waxwork and, while struggling to carry the heavy and unwieldy life-size figure in his arms through Paris streets, attracts public attention and is arrested for theft.
At his trial, the judge is Helene's father, while the defense attorney is Georges, the young romantic, who delivers an impassioned summation vividly describing how the defendant was overcome by patriotic fervor over Napoleon's victories and his contributions to the glory and grandeur of his beloved France. Although the judge finds Papa Chibou guilty, as required by law, he is so impressed that he suspends the punishment and contributes towards the purchase price of the figure which is given to Papa Chibou who then confesses that as an uneducated man he never knew that Napoleon had accomplished all those great deeds and that he simply formed a close attachment to him. ""Then who did you think Napoleon was"", he is asked. ""A sort of murderer"", he replies.[16] At that point, as he straightens Napoleon's pockets, Papa Chibou discovers the overlooked letter which explains and resolves Georges' and Helene's misunderstanding, thus allowing the young lovers an opportunity to declare their true feelings, with her father's blessing.",common convent earli decad newspap magazin film review describ writeup entir storylin includ substanti number instanc end thu unintent enabl subsequ gener reader reconstruct lost film content true form evalu seven face mordaunt hall new york times6 go consider detail regard plot twist relat herein below78910 papa chibou paul muni elderli caretak musé pratouchi parisian wax museum feel strong kinship figur particularli napoleon spot waxwork romant young coupl georg russel gleason lawyer helen marguerit churchil daughter stern judg lester lonergan disapprov daughter choic forbid see georg papa chibou suggest still stay touch without disobey father direct speak place secret person messag pocket napoleon uniform howev miss letter confus commun caus georg arriv mistaken conclus helen redirect affect toward foolish young man walter roger unworthi excess preoccupi stylish person appear eleg cloth see lover quarrel papa chibou attempt mollifi heat languag georg helen rebuff sooth word tell interfer sinc old man know noth love sadden reject dreamili imagin seven museum waxwork come life offer philosoph advic intricaci courtship love juan legendari 17th centuri libertin napoleon 1769–182111 franz schubert 1797–1828 african american boxer joe gan 1874–191012 willi smith cockney costermong becam music hall attract win lotteryauct known calcutta sweepstakes13 parisian hypnotist whose purport masteri dark art earn stage name diablero portray muni well catherin great 1729–1796 portray salka stenermann speak papa chibou uniqu manner accent provid insight person experi reflect intim topic1415 wax museum unabl support close owner monsieur pratouchi gustav von seyffertitz put figur auction papa chibou bid life save acquir napoleon outbid decid take waxwork struggl carri heavi unwieldi lifes figur arm pari street attract public attent arrest theft trial judg helen father defens attorney georg young romant deliv impass summat vividli describ defend overcom patriot fervor napoleon victori contribut glori grandeur belov franc although judg find papa chibou guilti requir law impress suspend punish contribut toward purchas price figur given papa chibou confess uneduc man never knew napoleon accomplish great deed simpli form close attach think napoleon ask sort murder replies16 point straighten napoleon pocket papa chibou discov overlook letter explain resolv georg helen misunderstand thu allow young lover opportun declar true feel father bless

A crowded block lined with tenement buildings, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, comes into view, followed by a look into the hallway of one of those buildings, then a shot is heard, a door to one of the apartments opens and a man holding a gun (Paul Muni) backs out, closes the door, puts the gun in his pocket, then walks down flights of stairs and into the busy street. While he passes along sidewalks teeming with human activity, an Irish American policeman berates a driver for parking in front of a hydrant, but when the driver removes his scarf, revealing a clerical collar, the abashed officer apologizes and offers to accompany the priest to the beat of ""that cop on the next corner, he's not one of us"". At that point, the shooter approaches and makes a gesture to speak, but the priest has already started to drive off, with the officer standing on the car's running board. Continuing to walk, the shooter reaches a police precinct and goes inside. Approaching the desk lieutenant (Clifford Dempsey), who asks, ""Well, what's on your mind?"", he replies, ""I killed a man"", explaining that the victim lived at 191 East 8th Street, was named John Harris, and ""deserved to die"". Asked for his own name, he hesitates and, spotting a wall calendar (showing May 1928) with a large ad for ""Dyke & Co., Inc."", says ""Dyke... James Dyke"". To ""Why are you giving yourself up?"", he answers ""It was the only thing to do"".
The subsequent title card states: ""Civilization demands its toll."" In court, the killer is only willing to explain that ""I never struck anybody in anger in all my life, but when I knew what he had done, I had to kill him."" The judge (Henry Kolker) ultimately proclaims that ""it is the duty of this court to sentence you to be executed at the state's prison during the week of August seventeenth.""
Another title card: ""Meanwhile------in a far-away home...."" In the backyard of a countryside house, a young woman (Marguerite Churchill) is attending to her dogs, while her wheelchair-bound mother (Edith Yorke) is sitting nearby. A young man (John Mack Brown) arrives and greets the mother as ""Mrs. Douglas"", while she addresses him as ""Robert"" and tells him that it was on such a nice day as this that she last saw her son Joe. Robert hands her ""your Columbus paper"" and goes to greet the young woman, ""Mary"", who calls him ""Bob"". He unsuccessfully attempts to help Mary bathe one of the dogs and, when she falls trying to catch the dog, Bob impulsively kisses her and then proposes. Mary's mother calls and shows them a photograph of ""James Dyke"" in the paper with the lead ""Condemned Man's Story Of His Life As It Should Have Been. A Lesson To Youth On Folly Of Crime By The Man Of Mystery"". She tells them that he looks like the long lost Joe, but Mary says that it must be a mistake and there's happy news in that Bob proposed and after the marriage they will all live together.
The next title card describes ""Gray walls, claiming their forfeits of liberty------and life."" Prisoners are seen laboring in a field outside the prison and, as they return to the mess hall for a meal, a stage above the dining area features an orchestra consisting of African American prisoners, replete with a smiling bandleader, playing dance music for the prisoners as they eat. ""Dyke"" is brought to the office of the warden (DeWitt Jennings) who asks him about any family members whom he might like to contact, but the condemned man replies that he has no one. Leaving the office, he hears the jaunty melodies resonating from the dining area and says, ""I didn't know you had music... here"". A newspaper's printing machines are seen churning out the evening edition with the headings: ""Mystery of Dyke's Identity Secret as Hour of Death Nears. Prisoner Staunchly Refuses to Divulge Secret of Himself or the Motive for His Crime Though He Faces Chair. James Dyke Maintains Silence as He Writes News Paper Articles Warning Youth on the Folly of Crime."" One of the printers (unbilled Robert Homans) tells the other that he heard the paper was paying Dyke $2,500 for his writings and that Dyke was buying Liberty Bonds with the money.
Sitting in her bedroom, the infirm Mrs. Douglas visualizes long-ago memories of teenage Joe (unbilled Barton Hepburn) describing to his little sister Mary about being cast in a local Shakespeare play and that, at bedtime, instead of ""goodnight"", she should recite to him the ""parting is such sweet sorrow"" lines and he would respond with the ""sleep dwell upon thine eyes"" lines. Meanwhile, in the living room, Mary and Bob are in the midst of a party to celebrate their engagement and, as the happy couple and invited guests dance, everyone joins in singing a fast chorus of ""Hosanna, hosanna, sing hosanna today"". Briefly leaving their guests to check on Mrs. Douglas, Mary and Bob hear from her that despite fragile health, she has decided to make the long trip to visit ""James Dyke"" in prison, because the possibility that he might be Joe is making the uncertainty unbearable. Mary offers to travel on her mother's behalf, with Bob accompanying her on the trip and, as they are riding on the train, a little girl passenger who says that her name is Suzanne (unbilled Helen Parrish) asks if they also have a little girl, prompting Mary to tell Bob that she couldn't marry him ""if this man in prison should be my brother"", because ""it wouldn't be fair to you"" and ""people are cruel"".
A title card indicates ""The test of the valiant."" Dyke is escorted to the warden who commends his exemplary behavior and asks what he wants done with the $2,500 in Liberty Bonds which are being held here in the office for him. Dyke replies that he'll think of something. Also present is the chaplain (Richard Carlyle) who, along with the warden, tries to convince him to see the young lady who traveled a thousand miles to speak with him in the hope that he might be her long-lost brother. Dyke eventually agrees, but requests privacy for the meeting, which is granted. The warden initially speaks with Mary alone, learning that she is from the (fictitious) town of Pennington in Ohio, that her father died when she was a baby, that Joe, who is ten years older, left home fifteen years ago because ""he wanted to be in the city"" and has not been heard from since. She is certain, however, that she could recognize him from his reactions to their long-ago ""goodnight"" verses from Romeo and Juliet.
As Dyke is brought into the office, the warden, the chaplain and the guard exit, leaving the two alone, but with all doors open. After Mary's explanation, Dyke denies being her brother, says he is from Canada, not Ohio, and does not react to the verses. As Mary is about to leave, however, he asks her to repeat her name and her brother's name and then tells her that when he served with the Canadian Forces during the War (World War I), a fellow showed great valor in sacrificing his life and the dead hero's name was Joseph Anthony Douglas. There will be a record of his service, but as occasionally happens in war, other details, including his ultimate fate, may be lost. However, she should take the unopened envelope (containing the Liberty Bonds) to her mother and buy for her a Gold Star to put on the front door in honor of her fallen son. Mary asks if there is anything she can do and he responds that her touch would mean the world to him.
After hugging him, Mary leaves with the envelope and then ""James Dyke"" softly recites to himself the ""sleep dwell upon thine eyes"" lines as the time for his execution arrives. Back in Pennington, Mary and Bob sit by the piano, while Mrs. Douglas rests in her wheelchair on the porch, visualizing marching doughboys and then her young son's smiling face while he is also wearing such a uniform. As Bob and Mary wheel her inside, the front door slowly swings closed, revealing the display of a large star.",credit accompani organ music endem silent film segu titl card citi streetwher laughter tragedi rub elbow crowd block line tenement build manhattan lower east side come view follow look hallway one build shot heard door one apart open man hold gun paul muni back close door put gun pocket walk flight stair busi street pass along sidewalk teem human activ irish american policeman berat driver park front hydrant driver remov scarf reveal cleric collar abash offic apolog offer accompani priest beat cop next corner he one us point shooter approach make gestur speak priest alreadi start drive offic stand car run board continu walk shooter reach polic precinct goe insid approach desk lieuten clifford dempsey ask well what mind repli kill man explain victim live 191 east 8th street name john harri deserv die ask name hesit spot wall calendar show may 1928 larg ad dyke co inc say dyke jame dyke give answer thing subsequ titl card state civil demand toll court killer will explain never struck anybodi anger life knew done kill judg henri kolker ultim proclaim duti court sentenc execut state prison week august seventeenth anoth titl card meanwhilein faraway home backyard countrysid hous young woman marguerit churchil attend dog wheelchairbound mother edith york sit nearbi young man john mack brown arriv greet mother mr dougla address robert tell nice day last saw son joe robert hand columbu paper goe greet young woman mari call bob unsuccess attempt help mari bath one dog fall tri catch dog bob impuls kiss propos mari mother call show photograph jame dyke paper lead condemn man stori life lesson youth folli crime man mysteri tell look like long lost joe mari say must mistak there happi news bob propos marriag live togeth next titl card describ gray wall claim forfeit libertyand life prison seen labor field outsid prison return mess hall meal stage dine area featur orchestra consist african american prison replet smile bandlead play danc music prison eat dyke brought offic warden dewitt jen ask famili member might like contact condemn man repli one leav offic hear jaunti melodi reson dine area say didnt know music newspap print machin seen churn even edit head mysteri dyke ident secret hour death near prison staunchli refus divulg secret motiv crime though face chair jame dyke maintain silenc write news paper articl warn youth folli crime one printer unbil robert homan tell heard paper pay dyke 2500 write dyke buy liberti bond money sit bedroom infirm mr dougla visual longago memori teenag joe unbil barton hepburn describ littl sister mari cast local shakespear play bedtim instead goodnight recit part sweet sorrow line would respond sleep dwell upon thine eye line meanwhil live room mari bob midst parti celebr engag happi coupl invit guest danc everyon join sing fast choru hosanna hosanna sing hosanna today briefli leav guest check mr dougla mari bob hear despit fragil health decid make long trip visit jame dyke prison possibl might joe make uncertainti unbear mari offer travel mother behalf bob accompani trip ride train littl girl passeng say name suzann unbil helen parrish ask also littl girl prompt mari tell bob couldnt marri man prison brother wouldnt fair peopl cruel titl card indic test valiant dyke escort warden commend exemplari behavior ask want done 2500 liberti bond held offic dyke repli hell think someth also present chaplain richard carlyl along warden tri convinc see young ladi travel thousand mile speak hope might longlost brother dyke eventu agre request privaci meet grant warden initi speak mari alon learn fictiti town pennington ohio father die babi joe ten year older left home fifteen year ago want citi heard sinc certain howev could recogn reaction longago goodnight vers romeo juliet dyke brought offic warden chaplain guard exit leav two alon door open mari explan dyke deni brother say canada ohio react vers mari leav howev ask repeat name brother name tell serv canadian forc war world war fellow show great valor sacrif life dead hero name joseph anthoni dougla record servic occasion happen war detail includ ultim fate may lost howev take unopen envelop contain liberti bond mother buy gold star put front door honor fallen son mari ask anyth respond touch would mean world hug mari leav envelop jame dyke softli recit sleep dwell upon thine eye line time execut arriv back pennington mari bob sit piano mr dougla rest wheelchair porch visual march doughboy young son smile face also wear uniform bob mari wheel insid front door slowli swing close reveal display larg star

1929,Welcome Danger,American,"Clyde Bruckman, Malcolm St. Clair",Harold Lloyd,comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_Danger,"Harold Bledsoe, a student of botany, is traveling by rail to San Francisco, where the captain of police has sent for him to help investigate a crime wave in the city's Chinatown district. Since Harold is the son of San Francisco's former police captain, municipal authorities hope he will be as skilled as his father in solving crimes. Also traveling to the city, but by car, are two people unknown to Harold. They are a young woman named Billie Lee and her little brother Buddy, who is in dire need of having his lame leg treated in San Francisco by ""the famous Chinese physician"" Dr. Chang Gow.[3][4]
During a brief train stop in Colorado, Harold has his photograph taken at a vending machine. He is surprised to see in the print the face of an attractive woman next to his. Actually, Billie Lee had taken her photo at the same machine before Harold, but the film failed to develop properly, thus leaving her image on his double-exposed print. Harold's train halts again later for a minor repair; and while waiting outside the passenger car, he sees an unusual blossom on a nearby tree. He goes to fetch it but is unable to reach high enough, so he stands on the back of a cow. Suddenly, the train's whistle blows, which causes the cow to bolt with Harold holding on desperately. The animal soon throws him off on a dirt road where Billie and Buddy's old car sits with an apparent engine problem. Harold does not recognise Billie as the woman on his photograph; in fact, he thinks she is a boy since she is wearing a man's cap and overalls to work on the engine. Harold tries to help, but he only complicates things and repeatedly insults Billie. After she removes the carburetor, a passing motorist suggests they check their car's gas tank, which is indeed empty. The motorist gives them some fuel; but after he leaves, Billie realizes that she left the carburetor on the other car's running board. Now they must spend the night along the roadside. Harold makes Billie do much of the work setting up camp as he sits mooning over the mysterious woman in his photograph. Billie saw earlier that it is her image, but she does not tell him. After enduring more physical and verbal abuse from Harold, she finally changes her clothes in a tent and then shocks him by reappearing in a dress. He now recognizes her and flees, embarrassed by his boorish behavior. She catches him and asks if he still thinks she is as beautiful as in the photograph; he says yes. Next morning, the trio harness the cow to pull their car to a gas station. Harold then separates from Billie and Buddy to catch another westbound train.
Once in San Francisco and at police headquarters, Harold is introduced to the process of fingerprinting, which intrigues him. He causes chaos at the station for the next two weeks by using the messy, fine black powder to take fingerprints of everyone at the building, including the print of a visitor, John Thorne, a respected citizen who is pressuring the police to crack down on crime. Harold's antics continue to anger staff at the station, so the desk sergeant hatches a scheme to get rid of him. He sends him on a mission to find the ""Dragon"", the mysterious master of the city's Chinese underworld. To ""aid"" Herold in his search, the sergeant gives him Mr. Thorne's fingerprint, but he lies and tells him it is the Dragon's print.
Harold goes to Chinatown, where he sees Billie in her car. She gives him the address where she and Buddy are residing in the city. Harold then passes a flower shop and sees a beautiful potted flower he wants to purchase for Billie, but the employees refuse to sell it. Determined to have one, he throws money on the floor and dashes out of the shop with the flower and evades two employees in hot pursuit. He next visits Billie and gives her the flower. Dr. Gow is also there examining Buddy's leg. As he departs, he accidentally knocks the flower off a table and breaks its pot, revealing a package of opium. Telling them to say nothing about the drug, the doctor goes to the flower shop, where he is kidnapped. Later, Harold and Billie hear radio news that Dr. Gow had been seized and may be killed. Fearing his death would deprive Buddy of any hope of a permanent recovery, Harold leaves to rescue the doctor.
In Chinatown, Harold sees Clancy, a street cop he had met earlier; and together they go to the shop. Aware of their presence, employees there set up a series of spooky effects to frighten them from the premises; yet, Harold and Clancy remain despite being terrified. Clancy does leave briefly to call for more officers before returning. Fights then begin with Chinese gang members and continue in passageways beneath the shop. Harold wanders through the basement area and soon encounters the masked Dragon and some of his men preparing to execute Dr. Gow. Harold manages to prevent the murder and struggles with the Dragon, who escapes with his hostage before the police burst in and arrest everyone else. When the police return to the station with Harold and gang members, Billie is already there, eager to find him. The police inform Harold about misleading him with the Dragon’s fingerprint. He is mortified until he notices in a mirror that in his fight with the Dragon, the drug lord had left his sooty fingerprint on Harold's forehead, and it matches Thorne's print.
Harold tries to explain the significance of this find to his colleagues, who only ridicule him. Thorne then appears at the station, and Harold instantly denounces him. As an influential public figure, Thorne is thought to be above suspicion, so the police apologize for Harold's behavior and try to detain him. He gets away and follows Thorne to his home, where he eventually extracts a confession from him. The police arrive and remain skeptical that Thorne is the Dragon until Harold finds Dr. Gow gagged and bound in a closet in Thorne's study. Thorne is arrested, and the film ends with Billie accepting Harold's clumsy proposal of marriage.",harold bledso student botani travel rail san francisco captain polic sent help investig crime wave citi chinatown district sinc harold son san francisco former polic captain municip author hope skill father solv crime also travel citi car two peopl unknown harold young woman name billi lee littl brother buddi dire need lame leg treat san francisco famou chines physician dr chang gow34 brief train stop colorado harold photograph taken vend machin surpris see print face attract woman next actual billi lee taken photo machin harold film fail develop properli thu leav imag doubleexpos print harold train halt later minor repair wait outsid passeng car see unusu blossom nearbi tree goe fetch unabl reach high enough stand back cow suddenli train whistl blow caus cow bolt harold hold desper anim soon throw dirt road billi buddi old car sit appar engin problem harold recognis billi woman photograph fact think boy sinc wear man cap overal work engin harold tri help complic thing repeatedli insult billi remov carburetor pass motorist suggest check car ga tank inde empti motorist give fuel leav billi realiz left carburetor car run board must spend night along roadsid harold make billi much work set camp sit moon mysteri woman photograph billi saw earlier imag tell endur physic verbal abus harold final chang cloth tent shock reappear dress recogn flee embarrass boorish behavior catch ask still think beauti photograph say ye next morn trio har cow pull car ga station harold separ billi buddi catch anoth westbound train san francisco polic headquart harold introduc process fingerprint intrigu caus chao station next two week use messi fine black powder take fingerprint everyon build includ print visitor john thorn respect citizen pressur polic crack crime harold antic continu anger staff station desk sergeant hatch scheme get rid send mission find dragon mysteri master citi chines underworld aid herold search sergeant give mr thorn fingerprint lie tell dragon print harold goe chinatown see billi car give address buddi resid citi harold pass flower shop see beauti pot flower want purchas billi employe refus sell determin one throw money floor dash shop flower evad two employe hot pursuit next visit billi give flower dr gow also examin buddi leg depart accident knock flower tabl break pot reveal packag opium tell say noth drug doctor goe flower shop kidnap later harold billi hear radio news dr gow seiz may kill fear death would depriv buddi hope perman recoveri harold leav rescu doctor chinatown harold see clanci street cop met earlier togeth go shop awar presenc employe set seri spooki effect frighten premis yet harold clanci remain despit terrifi clanci leav briefli call offic return fight begin chines gang member continu passageway beneath shop harold wander basement area soon encount mask dragon men prepar execut dr gow harold manag prevent murder struggl dragon escap hostag polic burst arrest everyon els polic return station harold gang member billi alreadi eager find polic inform harold mislead dragon ’ fingerprint mortifi notic mirror fight dragon drug lord left sooti fingerprint harold forehead match thorn print harold tri explain signific find colleagu ridicul thorn appear station harold instantli denounc influenti public figur thorn thought suspicion polic apolog harold behavior tri detain get away follow thorn home eventu extract confess polic arriv remain skeptic thorn dragon harold find dr gow gag bound closet thorn studi thorn arrest film end billi accept harold clumsi propos marriag

He cares for only one thing in life: his beloved daughter, Toyo. When he returns to the city of Vien-Tien from his latest foray in the jungle, Toyo tells him that she and Bobby Bailey, the son of an American circus owner (one of Tiger's best customers), have fallen in love and are engaged. Initially opposed to the union, Tiger gives them his blessing after Bobby protects the girl from a tiger that has gotten loose.
Tiger and Bobby take the captured animals down the river for shipment to Bobby's father. On the trip, Bobby becomes infatuated with the alluring Madame de Sylva. When Bobby introduces Tiger to her, they regard each other with intense hatred. Tiger takes Bobby off the ship to get him away from the woman. While waiting for the barge carrying the animals, he explains that Madame de Sylva is Toyo's mother. She ran away when Toyo was only a baby. Aghast, Bobby makes Tiger promise to keep the whole incident secret.
When they reach the port, Tiger is worried because Bobby and De Sylva will be sailing across the Pacific on the same ship. Bobby reassures him by instead returning with him to Toyo. However, Madame de Sylva arrives unexpectedly and is welcomed by an unsuspecting Toyo. De Sylva uses all her feminine wiles to try to lure Bobby away from her daughter. After Toyo overhears the truth in a heated argument between her parents, she tells Bobby she only wants him to be happy. That frees Bobby from the older woman's spell.
Tiger secretly opens the cage of an old gorilla who still remembers being mistreated by De Sylva long ago. It is implied that the femme fatale is killed.

1929,Words and Music,American,James Tinling,"Lois Moran, Helen Twelvetrees",musical comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_and_Music_(1929_film),"Two young college students, Phil (David Percy) and Pete (John Wayne), compete for the love of pretty girl named Mary (Lois Moran), and also to win the $1500 prize in a song-writing contest to write the best show tune for the annual college revue. The two men each ask Mary to sing for them, but eventually, she chooses Phil as her beau, and it is he who also has the winning song.
Although the film was largely devoid of much plot line, as was typical of musical revue pictures of the period, there is a great deal of singing and dancing. Many of Lois Moran’s numbers were actually footage that was cut from the film Fox Movietone Follies of 1929, which were edited out when the film was found to be too long. This film was created to make use of the deleted scenes, and so was fashioned around Moran’s singing talent. Songs include: ""Too Wonderful for Words"" (William Kernell, Dave Stamper, Paul Gerard Smith, Edmund Joseph), ""Stepping Along"" (Kernell), ""Shadows"" (Con Conrad, Sidney D.

1930,All Quiet on the Western Front,American,Lewis Milestone,"Lew Ayres, Louis Wolheim, Arnold Lucy","drama, war",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front_(1930_film),"Professor Kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the Army and ""saving the Fatherland"". On the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by Paul Baumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd Company. Their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Corporal Himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, ""You're going to be soldiers—and that's all.""
The new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. One in the group is killed before the new recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (Behn). The new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating. The young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. They have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. One of them, ""Kat"" Katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. The young soldiers ""pay"" for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes.
The new recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when Behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. After spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. They are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.
The men start out eating greedily, but then settle into a satiated torpor. They hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the causes of the war and of wars in general. They speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. Tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the Kaiser; Kat jokes that instead of having a war, they should have the leaders of Europe be stripped to their underwear and ""fight it out with clubs"".
One day, Corporal Himmelstoss arrives to the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation; he is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed. In an attack on a cemetery, Paul stabs a French soldier, but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. Throughout the night, he desperately tries to help him, bringing him water, but fails miserably to stop him from dying. He cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. Later, he returns to the German lines and is comforted by Kat.
Going back to the front line, Paul is severely wounded and taken to a Catholic hospital, along with his good friend Albert Kropp. Kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterwards. Around this time, Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive; but he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find Kropp in depression.
Paul is given a furlough and visits his family at home. He is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the actual situation of the war; everyone is convinced that a final ""push for Paris"" is soon to occur. When Paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds Professor Kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students. Professor Kantorek asks of Paul to detail his experience, to which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners; this revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call Paul a ""coward"". Disillusioned and angry, Paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd company that is filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by Tjaden. He goes to find Kat, and they discuss the inability of the people to comprehend the futility of the war. Kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital - only to find that Kat has been killed by a second explosion. Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul leaves.
In the final scene, Paul is back on the front lines. He sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. Paul smiles and reaches out towards the butterfly, but becoming too exposed, he is shot and killed by an enemy sniper. The final shot shows the 2nd Company arriving at the front for the first time, fading out to the image of a cemetery.",professor kantorek give impass speech glori serv armi save fatherland brink becom men boy class led paul baumer move join armi new 2nd compani romant delus quickli broken brief rigor train abus corpor himmelstoss bluntli inform your go soldiers—and that new soldier arriv train combat zone mayhem soldier everywher incom shell horsedrawn wagon race prolong rain one group kill new recruit reach post alarm one new soldier behn new soldier assign unit compos older soldier exactli accommod young soldier find food avail moment eaten sinc breakfast men join food two day one kat katczinski gone locat someth eat return slaughter hog stolen field kitchen young soldier pay dinner soap cigarett new recruit first trip trench veteran restr barb wire harrow experi especi behn blind shrapnel hyster run machinegun fire spend sever day bunker bombard last move trench success repuls enemi attack counterattack take enemi trench heavi casualti abandon sent back field kitchen get ration man receiv doubl help simpli number dead men start eat greedili settl satiat torpor hear return front next day begin semiseri discuss caus war war gener specul whether geograph entiti offend whether disagr involv tjaden speak familiarli kaiser kat joke instead war leader europ strip underwear fight club one day corpor himmelstoss arriv front immedi spurn bad reput forc go top 2nd compani promptli kill attack cemeteri paul stab french soldier find trap hole die man entir night throughout night desper tri help bring water fail miser stop die cri bitterli beg dead bodi speak forgiven later return german line comfort kat go back front line paul sever wound taken cathol hospit along good friend albert kropp kropp leg amput find time afterward around time paul taken bandag ward accord reput nobodi ever return aliv later return normal room triumphantli find kropp depress paul given furlough visit famili home shock uninform everyon actual situat war everyon convinc final push pari soon occur paul visit schoolroom origin recruit find professor kantorek prattl patriot fervor class even younger student professor kantorek ask paul detail experi latter reveal war like envis mention death partner revel upset professor well young student promptli call paul coward disillus angri paul return front come upon anoth 2nd compani fill new young recruit disillus happili greet tjaden goe find kat discuss inabl peopl comprehend futil war kat shin broken bomb drop aircraft fall nearbi paul carri back field hospit find kat kill second explos crush loss mentor paul leav final scene paul back front line see butterfli beyond trench paul smile reach toward butterfli becom expos shot kill enemi sniper final shot show 2nd compani arriv front first time fade imag cemeteri
1930,Animal Crackers,American,Victor Heerman,"Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Margaret Dumont",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crackers_(1930_film),"A newspaper headline explains that society matron Mrs. Rittenhouse is holding a lavish party at her home in Long Island. The party will host renowned explorer Captain Geoffrey (or Jeffrey) T. Spaulding as the guest of honor, recently returned from Africa. Also, as a special treat for the guests and Capt. Spaulding, revered art collector Roscoe W. Chandler will unveil his recently acquired painting by famous fictional artist Beaugard.
Hives instructs the servant crew on preparations for the party (""He's One Of Those Men""). Chandler arrives with the Beaugard and proceeds to set it up to be displayed. Capt. Spaulding's assistant Horatio Jameson announces the Captain's arrival (""I Represent The Captain"") (""Hooray for Captain Spaulding, Part I""). Capt. Spaulding makes a grand entrance and announces that he cannot stay and must leave immediately (Hello, I Must Be Going""). Mrs. Rittenhouse begs him to stay and the guests declare their admiration for the Captain and he decides to stay (""Hooray for Captain Spaulding, Part II""). Soon after, Signor Emanuel Ravelli arrives with his colleague the professor, hired to provide music for the weekend event. After an elaborate introduction, The Professor scares the guests away with a pistol he grabs from Capt. Spaulding's supplies. The Professor soon takes off chasing after an attractive blonde party-goer.
Mrs. Rittenhouse's daughter Arabella is attending the party with her fiancé John Parker, who is a struggling painter. John feels discouraged because he hasn't been able to make a living with his art in order to support himself and Arabella. Arabella suggests John do a portrait for Chandler, suggesting he would receive an impressive commission. John laughs at the idea, not believing Chandler to have a genuine appreciation for art. After examining the Beaugard, Arabella devises a scheme to win Chandler's interest in John's work: They'll replace the Beaugard with an almost perfect copy of it John painted in art school, since they can find no obvious differences. After the painting is unveiled at the party, they will surprise everyone and hopefully convince Chandler to hire John. Arabella asks Ravelli to switch the paintings. Meanwhile, another guest, neighbor Mrs. Whitehead thinks up the same idea with her friend Grace Carpenter as a means of humiliating Mrs. Rittenhouse. They grab Grace's poorly made copy that she painted and ask Hives to put it in place of the Beaugard, unaware that they are taking out John's copy.
Ravelli catches the Professor chasing after the blonde girl and scolds him. Soon Mrs. Rittenhouse and Mrs. Whitehead arrive and the four proceed to play an absurd variation on Bridge. Ravelli and the Professor run into Chandler and recognize him as Abie the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia. Chandler tries to bribe the two in order to keep them quiet, but they end up taking his money, tie and garters as well as, miraculously, Chandler's birthmark which is transferred to the Professor's arm. After a series of strange interludes while speaking with Mrs. Rittenhouse and Mrs. Whitehead, Capt. Spaulding has a debate with Chandler outside on the balcony after his encounter with Ravelli and the Professor.
Later that night in the middle of a thunderstorm, Ravelli and the Professor attempt to replace the Beaugard with the power going on and off, making the job more difficult. In the middle of the job Capt. Spaulding and Mrs. Rittenhouse wander in, making the job more difficult. They succeed in replacing the painting.
During the party, Mrs. Rittenhouse invites Capt. Spaulding to speak about his travels in Africa. He proceeds to tell a ridiculous and absurd account of his travels before Mrs. Rittenhouse cuts him off. Signor Ravelli is invited to play some selection on the piano (I'm Daffy Over You"", ""Silver Threads Among The Gold"", ""Gypsy Chorus""). After several quips and interruptions Chandler invites the guests into the parlor so he can unveil the Beaugard. Once revealed, Chandler notices the poor quality and realizes someone has stolen his painting and replaced it with a cheap imitation. John feels discouraged, thinking the painting is still his copy. Suddenly the power goes out, and when restored, the imitation Beaugard is missing as well. The guests, now in an uproar, scatter and attempt to find the stolen painting, led by Capt. Spaulding. John and Arabella discuss the excitement of the situation and their love for each other (""Why Am I So Romantic?"").
The next day, a police squad arrives to secure the house and search for the missing painting. Realizing that they may have gone too far, Mrs. Whitehead and Grace ask Hives for the Beaugard he took back, but he can't find it anywhere. Mrs. Whitehead deduces the Professor must have stolen it. After confronting him she gets Grace's copy back. Later, John finds Grace's copy of the Beaugard and reveals to Arabella that someone else must have had the same idea as them. Realizing that Chandler never actually saw John's copy, they become more hopeful. Soon after John realizes the copy he found is now missing. Capt. Spaulding, Jameson, and Ravelli discuss how they might go about finding the missing painting. After getting the painting back from the Professor, who is now in disguise, John and Arabella bring it to Capt. Spaulding. They figure out that the Professor must be the one who stole the paintings, and enlist the police to help find him.
After a brief altercation Spaulding, Ravelli, and Jameson enter with the Professor (""My Old Kentucky Home""). The Professor is apprehended and the three paintings are returned. Chandler momentarily mistakes John's copy for the Beaugard. Realizing his talent, Chandler hires John to do a series a portraits for him. After momentarily letting the Professor go free, the police sergeant tries to apprehend him. To escape arrest, the Professor sprays the guests with a knockout substance from a Flit can. After everyone is laid out on the floor and fully subdued, the film concludes with the Professor knocking himself out next to the pretty blonde he has been chasing throughout the entire film.",newspap headlin explain societi matron mr rittenhous hold lavish parti home long island parti host renown explor captain geoffrey jeffrey spauld guest honor recent return africa also special treat guest capt spauld rever art collector rosco w chandler unveil recent acquir paint famou fiction artist beaugard hive instruct servant crew prepar parti he one men chandler arriv beaugard proce set display capt spauld assist horatio jameson announc captain arriv repres captain hooray captain spauld part capt spauld make grand entranc announc stay must leav immedi hello must go mr rittenhous beg stay guest declar admir captain decid stay hooray captain spauld part ii soon signor emanuel ravelli arriv colleagu professor hire provid music weekend event elabor introduct professor scare guest away pistol grab capt spauld suppli professor soon take chase attract blond partygo mr rittenhous daughter arabella attend parti fiancé john parker struggl painter john feel discourag hasnt abl make live art order support arabella arabella suggest john portrait chandler suggest would receiv impress commiss john laugh idea believ chandler genuin appreci art examin beaugard arabella devis scheme win chandler interest john work theyll replac beaugard almost perfect copi john paint art school sinc find obviou differ paint unveil parti surpris everyon hope convinc chandler hire john arabella ask ravelli switch paint meanwhil anoth guest neighbor mr whitehead think idea friend grace carpent mean humili mr rittenhous grab grace poorli made copi paint ask hive put place beaugard unawar take john copi ravelli catch professor chase blond girl scold soon mr rittenhous mr whitehead arriv four proceed play absurd variat bridg ravelli professor run chandler recogn abi fish peddler czechoslovakia chandler tri bribe two order keep quiet end take money tie garter well miracul chandler birthmark transfer professor arm seri strang interlud speak mr rittenhous mr whitehead capt spauld debat chandler outsid balconi encount ravelli professor later night middl thunderstorm ravelli professor attempt replac beaugard power go make job difficult middl job capt spauld mr rittenhous wander make job difficult succeed replac paint parti mr rittenhous invit capt spauld speak travel africa proce tell ridicul absurd account travel mr rittenhous cut signor ravelli invit play select piano im daffi silver thread among gold gypsi choru sever quip interrupt chandler invit guest parlor unveil beaugard reveal chandler notic poor qualiti realiz someon stolen paint replac cheap imit john feel discourag think paint still copi suddenli power goe restor imit beaugard miss well guest uproar scatter attempt find stolen paint led capt spauld john arabella discuss excit situat love romant next day polic squad arriv secur hous search miss paint realiz may gone far mr whitehead grace ask hive beaugard took back cant find anywher mr whitehead deduc professor must stolen confront get grace copi back later john find grace copi beaugard reveal arabella someon els must idea realiz chandler never actual saw john copi becom hope soon john realiz copi found miss capt spauld jameson ravelli discuss might go find miss paint get paint back professor disguis john arabella bring capt spauld figur professor must one stole paint enlist polic help find brief alterc spauld ravelli jameson enter professor old kentucki home professor apprehend three paint return chandler momentarili mistak john copi beaugard realiz talent chandler hire john seri portrait momentarili let professor go free polic sergeant tri apprehend escap arrest professor spray guest knockout substanc flit everyon laid floor fulli subdu film conclud professor knock next pretti blond chase throughout entir film

They are pursued by ""Bob Cat"" Manners and his posse. As they close in on the bank, owned by Perkins, Montero becomes involved in the personal affairs of Helen Wardell and her fiancé, Howard. Perkins is also interested in Wardell, and he also holds the mortgage on Howard's ranch. Finding out that Montero has a price on his head, Perkins uses that fact to coerce Montero into agreeing to kill Howard. Perkins, however, has no intention of paying Montero, instead arranging for the posse to capture the outlaw.

1930,The Big House,American,George W. Hill,"Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery, Lewis Stone",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_House_(1930_film),"Kent (Robert Montgomery), a drunk driver who carelessly kills a man, is sentenced to ten years for manslaughter. In an overcrowded prison designed for 1800 and actually holding 3000, he is placed in a cell with Butch (Wallace Beery) and Morgan (Chester Morris), the two leaders of the inmates. Butch is alternately menacing and friendly, while Morgan tries to help out the frightened, inexperienced youngster, but Kent rebuffs his overtures.
When Butch is ordered into solitary confinement for sparking a protest over the prison food, he passes along his knife before being searched. It ends up in Kent's hands. Meanwhile, Morgan is notified that he is to be paroled. Prior to a search of their cell, Kent hides the knife in Morgan's bed. When it is found, Morgan's parole is canceled, and he is put in solitary as well. He vows to make Kent pay for what he has done.
When Morgan is let out of solitary, he escapes by switching places with a corpse on the way to the morgue. He makes his way to the bookstore run by Kent's beautiful sister, Anne (Leila Hyams). She, however, recognizes him. She manages to get his gun and starts to call the police, but then changes her mind and gives him back his pistol. Morgan (who has been attracted to Anne since he saw Kent's photograph of her) gets a job and becomes better acquainted with Anne and her family. They all like him, especially Anne. However, he is caught and sent back to prison.
When Butch tells Morgan of his plan for a jailbreak on Thanksgiving, Morgan tells him that he is going straight. In return for a promise of freedom, Kent informs the warden (Lewis Stone) of the attempt, though he is not privy to the details. Despite the warning, the inmates succeed in taking over the prison, capturing many of the guards, though they are unable to force their way out. Thwarted, Butch threatens to shoot the guards one by one unless they are allowed to escape. When the warden stands firm, Butch shoots the warden's right-hand man in cold blood, then tosses the dying man out for all to see.
Army tanks are called to break down the entrance. Morgan grabs a pistol from the prisoner assigned to watch the guards. He finds Kent cowering with the guard but spares him. Kent panics and flees before Morgan locks the guards in to save their lives. When Kent tries to open the front doors, he is killed in the crossfire. Butch is told that Morgan was the ""stoolie"" who tipped off the warden and learns he has put the guards out of danger. He sets out to kill his former friend. In the ensuing gunfight, both are wounded, Butch fatally. Before he dies, he learns that Kent was actually the informer, and he and Morgan reconcile. For his efforts, Morgan is given a full pardon. When he exits the prison, Anne rushes to embrace him.",kent robert montgomeri drunk driver carelessli kill man sentenc ten year manslaught overcrowd prison design 1800 actual hold 3000 place cell butch wallac beeri morgan chester morri two leader inmat butch altern menac friendli morgan tri help frighten inexperienc youngster kent rebuff overtur butch order solitari confin spark protest prison food pass along knife search end kent hand meanwhil morgan notifi parol prior search cell kent hide knife morgan bed found morgan parol cancel put solitari well vow make kent pay done morgan let solitari escap switch place corps way morgu make way bookstor run kent beauti sister ann leila hyam howev recogn manag get gun start call polic chang mind give back pistol morgan attract ann sinc saw kent photograph get job becom better acquaint ann famili like especi ann howev caught sent back prison butch tell morgan plan jailbreak thanksgiv morgan tell go straight return promis freedom kent inform warden lewi stone attempt though privi detail despit warn inmat succeed take prison captur mani guard though unabl forc way thwart butch threaten shoot guard one one unless allow escap warden stand firm butch shoot warden righthand man cold blood toss die man see armi tank call break entranc morgan grab pistol prison assign watch guard find kent cower guard spare kent panic flee morgan lock guard save live kent tri open front door kill crossfir butch told morgan stooli tip warden learn put guard danger set kill former friend ensu gunfight wound butch fatal die learn kent actual inform morgan reconcil effort morgan given full pardon exit prison ann rush embrac

1930,The Big Trail,American,Raoul Walsh,"John Wayne, Marguerite Churchill",western,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Trail,"A large caravan of settlers attempt to cross the Oregon Trail. Breck Coleman (John Wayne) is a young trapper who just got back to Missouri from his travels near Santa Fe, seeking to avenge the death of an old trapper friend who was killed the winter before along the Santa Fe Trail for his furs, by Red Flack (Tyrone Power, Sr.) and his minion Lopez (Charles Stevens). At a large trading post owned by a man named Wellmore, Coleman sees Flack and suspects him right away as being one of the killers. Flack likewise suspects Coleman as being somebody who knows too much about the killing. Coleman is asked by a large group of settlers to scout their caravan west, and declines, until he learns that Flack and Lopez were just hired by Wellmore to boss a bull train along the as-yet-unblazed Oregon Trail to a trading post in northern Oregon Territory (which at the time extended into current British Columbia), owned by another Missouri fur trader. Coleman agrees to scout for the train, so he can keep an eye on the villains and kill them as soon as they reach their destination. The caravan of settlers in their Prairie schooners would follow Wellmore's ox-drawn train of Conestoga Wagons, as the first major group of settlers to move west on the Oregon Trail. The film is set somewhere between 1837 and 1845.[notes 1] This is historically accurate, as the first major wave of settlers on the Oregon Trail was in 1843, although the details were completely different.
Coleman finds love with young Ruth Cameron (Marguerite Churchill), whom he'd kissed accidentally, mistaking her for somebody else. Unwilling to accept her attraction toward him, Ruth gets rather close to a gambler acquaintance of Flack's, Thorpe (Ian Keith), who joined the trail after being caught gambling. Coleman and Flack have to lead the settlers west, while Flack does everything he can to have Coleman killed before he finds any proof of what he'd done. The three villains' main reason for going west is to avoid the hangman's noose for previous crimes, and all three receive frontier justice instead. The settlers trail ends in an un-named valley, where Coleman and Ruth finally settle down together amidst giant redwoods.",larg caravan settler attempt cross oregon trail breck coleman john wayn young trapper got back missouri travel near santa fe seek aveng death old trapper friend kill winter along santa fe trail fur red flack tyron power sr minion lopez charl steven larg trade post own man name wellmor coleman see flack suspect right away one killer flack likewis suspect coleman somebodi know much kill coleman ask larg group settler scout caravan west declin learn flack lopez hire wellmor boss bull train along asyetunblaz oregon trail trade post northern oregon territori time extend current british columbia own anoth missouri fur trader coleman agre scout train keep eye villain kill soon reach destin caravan settler prairi schooner would follow wellmor oxdrawn train conestoga wagon first major group settler move west oregon trail film set somewher 1837 1845note 1 histor accur first major wave settler oregon trail 1843 although detail complet differ coleman find love young ruth cameron marguerit churchil hed kiss accident mistak somebodi els unwil accept attract toward ruth get rather close gambler acquaint flack thorp ian keith join trail caught gambl coleman flack lead settler west flack everyth coleman kill find proof hed done three villain main reason go west avoid hangman noos previou crime three receiv frontier justic instead settler trail end unnam valley coleman ruth final settl togeth amidst giant redwood
1930,The Bishop Murder Case,American,Nick Grinde,"Basil Rathbone, Leila Hyams, Roland Young",mystery,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bishop_Murder_Case_(film),"Looking out from his private balcony, elderly Prof. Dillard and his servant see the body of family friend Joseph Robin with an arrow in his chest. Dillard calls district attorney Markham, who brings in private detective Philo Vance and lazy police detective Heath. Vance quickly deduces that the arrow scene was staged (Robin was actually bludgeoned inside the house), but there is no obvious suspect.
Vance and the others repeatedly interview Dillard and his friends and neighbors. Living with Dillard is his niece Belle; Dillard's adopted son, Sigurd Arnesson, who is also Belle's boyfriend, returns from college on hearing of the crime. In the next house are the Drukkers, a brother and sister: she feels responsible for a serious injury he still suffers from, and is now very frail and agoraphobic. She says she saw nothing of the crime; her brother says he heard her screaming in her room, which she denies. He also admits to being in Dillard's house before the murder. Another neighbor is John Pardee, a chess enthusiast, who seems to be overly interested in the case.
A taunting typewritten note is found, signed ""The Bishop"". It alludes to the nursery rhyme ""Cock Robin"": Robin was nicknamed Cock Robin, and another visitor at the house that day was named Sperling—German for ""Sparrow"". However, Sperling eventually proves to have a solid alibi. Dillard has no typewriter in the house, and neither Drukker's nor Bishop's matches the note.
Later a friend of Arnesson's, named John, is found murdered. He was shot in the top of the head, apparently in allusion to Jack's injury in the rhyme ""Jack and Jill"". Then Drukker, sitting on a low wall in a park at night, is pulled off the wall and murdered. ""The Bishop"" continues sending notes about each crime, connecting the last one to ""Humpty Dumpty"". Drukker's sister is found dead also, perhaps from fright, and a valuable notebook about his research work is missing from their home. A chess bishop has been left in her hand.
Heath and Markham become suspicious of Pardee and go to arrest him, but find him dead. Next to his body, obviously built after he died, is a house of cards with a chess bishop on top: it is ""This Is the House That Jack Built"". Later, Dillard expresses some misgivings about Arnesson, and mentions the Henrik Ibsen play The Pretenders, which Arnesson is fond of.
That night, after Belle says goodnight to Arnesson, she makes her way into the attic and finds the typewriter that ""The Bishop"" used for his notes. At this point she is jumped from behind.
Mulling over Dillard's words later that night, Vance suddenly realizes that one of the characters in The Pretenders is a bishop—named Arnesson. He rushes back to Dillard's house together with Markham, Heath, and more police. Arnesson's window is open and neither he nor Belle is in their room. Dillard joins the group to search the house, breaking down the locked door to the attic. There they find the typewriter, but not Belle, who is lying bound and gagged in a nearby cupola.
Downstairs, they are talking to Dillard when Arnesson returns. When Vance accuses him, he acts guilty. Meanwhile Dillard surreptitiously pours some powder from a compartment in his ring into a wine glass. As things calm down and Arnesson is about to be arrested, Dillard offers him a glass, then pours more wine for himself; but Vance announces that he has switched the glasses.
Dillard is the murderer, and was trying to fake Arnesson's suicide. He wanted to be Belle's only friend. He originally only intended to kill Robin and frame Arnesson, but developed the more elaborate scheme when he realized Miss Drukker must have witnessed his actions. Vance had tipped Arnesson to act guilty, and had Heath search the cupola after Dillard left the attic; Belle is fine.
Arnesson and Belle embrace, and Vance stops Heath from carelessly drinking the poison.",look privat balconi elderli prof dillard servant see bodi famili friend joseph robin arrow chest dillard call district attorney markham bring privat detect philo vanc lazi polic detect heath vanc quickli deduc arrow scene stage robin actual bludgeon insid hous obviou suspect vanc other repeatedli interview dillard friend neighbor live dillard niec bell dillard adopt son sigurd arnesson also bell boyfriend return colleg hear crime next hous drukker brother sister feel respons seriou injuri still suffer frail agoraphob say saw noth crime brother say heard scream room deni also admit dillard hous murder anoth neighbor john parde chess enthusiast seem overli interest case taunt typewritten note found sign bishop allud nurseri rhyme cock robin robin nicknam cock robin anoth visitor hous day name sperling—german sparrow howev sperl eventu prove solid alibi dillard typewrit hous neither drukker bishop match note later friend arnesson name john found murder shot top head appar allus jack injuri rhyme jack jill drukker sit low wall park night pull wall murder bishop continu send note crime connect last one humpti dumpti drukker sister found dead also perhap fright valuabl notebook research work miss home chess bishop left hand heath markham becom suspici parde go arrest find dead next bodi obvious built die hous card chess bishop top hous jack built later dillard express misgiv arnesson mention henrik ibsen play pretend arnesson fond night bell say goodnight arnesson make way attic find typewrit bishop use note point jump behind mull dillard word later night vanc suddenli realiz one charact pretend bishop—nam arnesson rush back dillard hous togeth markham heath polic arnesson window open neither bell room dillard join group search hous break lock door attic find typewrit bell lie bound gag nearbi cupola downstair talk dillard arnesson return vanc accus act guilti meanwhil dillard surreptiti pour powder compart ring wine glass thing calm arnesson arrest dillard offer glass pour wine vanc announc switch glass dillard murder tri fake arnesson suicid want bell friend origin intend kill robin frame arnesson develop elabor scheme realiz miss drukker must wit action vanc tip arnesson act guilti heath search cupola dillard left attic bell fine arnesson bell embrac vanc stop heath carelessli drink poison

1930,Bride of the Regiment,American,John Francis Dillon,"Vivienne Segal, Walter Pidgeon",musical,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_of_the_Regiment,"The film takes place during a period in which Austria controlled Italy during the Austro-Italian War of 1830. Colonel Vultow, played by Walter Pidgeon, leader of Austrian cavalry regiment, is sent to Italy to put down a revolt led by the Lombardian aristocracy. Vultow decides to go to the castle of Count Adrian Beltrami, played by Allan Prior, one of the leaders of the revolution. This happens to be Beltrami's wedding day. As he is emerging from the church following his wedding to Countess Anna-Marie (Vivienne Segal), Beltrami learns that Colonel Vultow is quickly approaching the town in search of him. At the behest of his bride, Beltrami flees the castle, but he asks Tangy, a silhouette cutter, to impersonate him and protect Anna-Marie. When Adrian returns in disguise, he is introduced to Vultow as a singer and silhouette cutter, and when the count demands he create a silhouette, he enlists Tangy's aid. The deception is discovered, and Vultow sentences Adrian to death by a firing squad unless Anna-Marie submits to his sexual demands.
Eager to save her husband, Anna-Marie shows a portrait of her great-grandmother to Vultow and explains why the woman is wearing only an ermine cloak. Her ancestor once killed a man to protect her honor, and the countess fears she will be forced to do the same. The painting comes to life and Anna-Marie's great-grandmother steps down from the frame and embraces Vultow, now drunk on champagne. He falls asleep and dreams Anna-Marie willingly gives herself to him, and when he awakens, he orders Adrian to be freed in the mistaken belief Anna-Marie is now his. When Vultow receives news that the Italian troops are advancing, he departs, and the count and countess are reunited.
The film was full of so much Pre-Code humor that it ran into censorship problems in many areas.[2] The film drew large crowds in Chicago where it played as an ""Adults Only"" feature. The soundtrack reveals some amazingly suggestive dialogue. In one sequence, Myrna Loy (playing a depraved dancer named Sophie) finds out Vultow (Walter Pidgeon) who had previously fallen for her charms and made love to her has met with Anna-Marie (Vivienne Segal) and fallen for her charms and has completely forgotten about her. Sophie declares ""I'll get him back! I'll dance until his blood is steaming!"" and proceeds to begin a smoldering dance number on top of a long dinner table in a very seductive manner in an attempt to lure back Vultow from the charms of Anna-Marie. In another scene, Vultow has a conversation with Anna-Marie. He believes he has had sexual relations with her during the previous night. In reality, however, he dozed off after drinking too much liquor and dreamed the entire episode. The conversation runs as follows:",film take place period austria control itali austroitalian war 1830 colonel vultow play walter pidgeon leader austrian cavalri regiment sent itali put revolt led lombardian aristocraci vultow decid go castl count adrian beltrami play allan prior one leader revolut happen beltrami wed day emerg church follow wed countess annamari vivienn segal beltrami learn colonel vultow quickli approach town search behest bride beltrami flee castl ask tangi silhouett cutter imperson protect annamari adrian return disguis introduc vultow singer silhouett cutter count demand creat silhouett enlist tangi aid decept discov vultow sentenc adrian death fire squad unless annamari submit sexual demand eager save husband annamari show portrait greatgrandmoth vultow explain woman wear ermin cloak ancestor kill man protect honor countess fear forc paint come life annamari greatgrandmoth step frame embrac vultow drunk champagn fall asleep dream annamari willingli give awaken order adrian freed mistaken belief annamari vultow receiv news italian troop advanc depart count countess reunit film full much precod humor ran censorship problem mani areas2 film drew larg crowd chicago play adult featur soundtrack reveal amazingli suggest dialogu one sequenc myrna loy play deprav dancer name sophi find vultow walter pidgeon previous fallen charm made love met annamari vivienn segal fallen charm complet forgotten sophi declar ill get back ill danc blood steam proce begin smolder danc number top long dinner tabl seduct manner attempt lure back vultow charm annamari anoth scene vultow convers annamari believ sexual relat previou night realiti howev doze drink much liquor dream entir episod convers run follow
1930,Bright Lights,American,Michael Curtiz,"James Murray, Noah Beery, Dorothy Mackaill",musical,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_Lights_(1930_film),"Successful actress Louanne (Dorothy Mackaill) is about to marry a rich man instead of the man she really loves, Wally Dean (Frank Fay). As the film begins, Louanne is giving her last performance as she plans to retire once she is married. A group of reporters comes to interview Louanne and while she tells them a story which she thinks is appropriate for a soon-to-be wife of a wealthy socialite, the scene flashes back to her actual past.
It is revealed that Louanne was once a dancer at a low-class cafe. Portuguese smuggler Miguel Parada (Noah Beery), took an interest in her and attempted to force his affections on her. Wally Dean, who was, even then, her constant companion, manages to escape with her from the cafe as a riot is about to start. Another flashback shows Wally as a barker at a carnival with Louanne as a dancer. Again Wally saves Louanne from an imminent riot. Back in the present, Louanne continues to lie to the reporters and tell them about her genteel background.
Fish (Frank McHugh), one of the reporters, does not believe her story but says nothing. When Louanne returns to the stage to resume her performance, Miguel, who happens to be in the audience, recognizes her and goes to her dressing room because he has some ""unfinished business"" with her. Louanne enters her dressing room and is shocked to find Miguel. Wally soon appears and pretends he has a gun to intimidate Miguel; he gives the ""gun"" to Connie Lamont (James Murray) because he has to go on stage. While Connie is guarding Miguel, a fight erupts between the two and Miguel reveals that he has a real gun. In the struggle for it, Miguel is shot and he dies.
When the police arrive, Wally tries to convince the police that Miguel committed suicide to save Louanne from a scandal before her marriage. Louanne's friend Peggy (Inez Courtney) also gives false testimony to save her. The police remain unconvinced until the reporter, Fish, gives false testimony that he actually saw Miguel pull the trigger. Louanne is cleared and realizes that she really loves Wally.

1930,Call of the Flesh,American,Charles Brabin,"Ramón Novarro, Dorothy Jordan, Ernest Torrence",musical,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_the_Flesh,"In Seville, Spain, a cantina is located across the street from San Agustín convent. At the convent, postulant Maria Consuelo Vargas (Dorothy Jordan) receives a visit from her brother, Captain Enrique Vargas (Russell Hopton). They have not seen each other in seven years, as he has been stationed in Africa. During the intervening time, their mother has died, which left Maria alone in the world, until she entered the convent. Enrique is thrilled that she will soon be married to God. Maria is enthralled by the music that comes from across the street – implying that she wants to explore life outside the convent - but Enrique prefers that she remain behind the safety of the convent walls, as he considers the outside world evil.
After Enrique leaves, Maria peers over the convent walls to watch Juan de Dios (Ramon Novarro) perform at the cantina. Later in the set, Juan sings and dances with his partner, Lola (Renée Adorée). After the set, Juan flirts with some female customers, which irks Lola. Juan walks Lola home, during which time he treats her badly, knowing that she is in love with him, and thus will tolerate the abuse.
At home, Juan meets with his music teacher, Esteban (Ernest Torrence). Esteban believes Juan has the makings of a great singer like he himself once was. Esteban squandered away his fame and fortune by reckless behavior – the same reckless behavior Juan now exhibits – which he is trying to steer Juan away from. If his old contacts will listen, Esteban plans to take Juan to Madrid so that he can truly become a great serious singer under the management of one of the great impresarios.
After a day outing at the market where he steals some oranges and some cloth and thus is trying to escape from the police, Juan runs into Maria in a private courtyard, she who he has never met. She has escaped from the convent and is stealing a dress from a clothes line to replace her convent garb. She leaves a token for the dress. She recognizes him. As she tells him she has no home, he, who is immediately attracted to her, takes her home with him. Maria eventually tells Juan that she has escaped from the convent to find “him”, as she has always been drawn to the magic that is his singing. Then, Lola shows up. Juan is able to make her go away without knowing that Maria is there.
Esteban believes Maria to be nothing more than a street harlot, but Juan is able to convince him that she is a child of God. Juan then tells Esteban that they will indeed go to Madrid, and bring Maria along as their housekeeper.
At the convent, Enrique is trying to find Maria. The Mother Superior (Nance O'Neil) tells him that as Maria had not yet taken her vows, she was free to leave. Maria being drawn to music may provide a clue as to her whereabouts. Then, Lola arrives – she has found a convent garment in Juan’s room, the garment which Enrique and the Mother Superior recognize as Maria’s. Enrique vows to travel to Madrid to kill Juan.
In Madrid, Juan, Esteban and Maria rent a three-bedroom flat that is managed by a music aficionado, La Rumbarita (Mathilde Comont). A once great singer used to reside there, which they all believe is karma. Later at the audition with impresario Mischa, Juan displays his arrogant attitude about what he sees as the greatness of his singing. Although the audition is technically sound, Mischa tells Juan that he has no soul in his singing, and that he needs to have his heart broken to achieve true greatness. As such, Mischa, will not accept him as a client. After Juan storms out in disgust, Esteban negotiates payment – all the money that he has - to Mischa to take Juan on as a client in lower level musical events, Juan not to know the financial arrangement. Mischa happily agrees, seeing this arrangement as a windfall.
Back at the flat, Juan, angry about Mischa’s assessment, takes it out on Maria by berating her. But seeing how loyal she is to him, Juan changes his tune and declares his undying love for her. They embrace. Later, he visits a priest to make arrangements for their marriage. As Juan tells Esteban and La Rumbarita of the wedding, they go off to buy items for an engagement celebration party, but not before Esteban is able to tell Juan that Mischa has arranged for him to sing Pagliacci that evening. Juan is excited, but believes that Mischa has just come to his senses, not knowing about Esteban and Mischa’s financial arrangement.
While Juan is alone at the flat, Enrique tracks Juan down, ready to kill him. Although they initially argue about the situation with Maria, Enrique, with a little help from Lola, is able to convince Juan to send Maria back to the convent, as his act of love is stealing her away from her vow to God, and that she would always be seen as harlot if they were to get married, thus sending her to eternal damnation. Knowing that Maria will not go willingly, Juan convinces Maria that he no longer loves her as he has reconciled with Lola. A tearful Maria, now believing the outside world is evil as Enrique once said, leaves with her brother back to Seville and San Agustín.
Despite Juan’s broken heart, Esteban is able to convince Juan to proceed with the performance of Pagliacci by telling him the truth about his and Mischa’s financial arrangement. Juan’s performance ends up being a triumph, with Juan emotionally spent after it. Mischa remarks that this Juan and the Juan at the audition are two totally different people. Mischa now wants to sign a legitimate contract with Juan. Regardless, Juan does not recover emotionally. As Esteban takes him back to Seville, Juan is bedridden, dying from a broken heart. Seeing what is happening to Juan, Lola decides to go to the convent to tell Maria the truth about their deception, which Lola now knows will lead to certain death for both Juan and Maria of broken hearts. Maria rushes to Juan’s side, the two who enter into a loving embrace.",sevil spain cantina locat across street san agustín convent convent postul maria consuelo varga dorothi jordan receiv visit brother captain enriqu varga russel hopton seen seven year station africa interven time mother die left maria alon world enter convent enriqu thrill soon marri god maria enthral music come across street – impli want explor life outsid convent enriqu prefer remain behind safeti convent wall consid outsid world evil enriqu leav maria peer convent wall watch juan de dio ramon novarro perform cantina later set juan sing danc partner lola rené adoré set juan flirt femal custom irk lola juan walk lola home time treat badli know love thu toler abus home juan meet music teacher esteban ernest torrenc esteban believ juan make great singer like esteban squander away fame fortun reckless behavior – reckless behavior juan exhibit – tri steer juan away old contact listen esteban plan take juan madrid truli becom great seriou singer manag one great impresario day outing market steal orang cloth thu tri escap polic juan run maria privat courtyard never met escap convent steal dress cloth line replac convent garb leav token dress recogn tell home immedi attract take home maria eventu tell juan escap convent find “ ” alway drawn magic sing lola show juan abl make go away without know maria esteban believ maria noth street harlot juan abl convinc child god juan tell esteban inde go madrid bring maria along housekeep convent enriqu tri find maria mother superior nanc oneil tell maria yet taken vow free leav maria drawn music may provid clue whereabout lola arriv – found convent garment juan ’ room garment enriqu mother superior recogn maria ’ enriqu vow travel madrid kill juan madrid juan esteban maria rent threebedroom flat manag music aficionado la rumbarita mathild comont great singer use resid believ karma later audit impresario mischa juan display arrog attitud see great sing although audit technic sound mischa tell juan soul sing need heart broken achiev true great mischa accept client juan storm disgust esteban negoti payment – money mischa take juan client lower level music event juan know financi arrang mischa happili agre see arrang windfal back flat juan angri mischa ’ assess take maria berat see loyal juan chang tune declar undi love embrac later visit priest make arrang marriag juan tell esteban la rumbarita wed go buy item engag celebr parti esteban abl tell juan mischa arrang sing pagliacci even juan excit believ mischa come sens know esteban mischa ’ financi arrang juan alon flat enriqu track juan readi kill although initi argu situat maria enriqu littl help lola abl convinc juan send maria back convent act love steal away vow god would alway seen harlot get marri thu send etern damnat know maria go willingli juan convinc maria longer love reconcil lola tear maria believ outsid world evil enriqu said leav brother back sevil san agustín despit juan ’ broken heart esteban abl convinc juan proceed perform pagliacci tell truth mischa ’ financi arrang juan ’ perform end triumph juan emot spent mischa remark juan juan audit two total differ peopl mischa want sign legitim contract juan regardless juan recov emot esteban take back sevil juan bedridden die broken heart see happen juan lola decid go convent tell maria truth decept lola know lead certain death juan maria broken heart maria rush juan ’ side two enter love embrac

Correll, Duke Ellington",comedy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_and_Double_Check,"Amos and Andy run the ""Fresh Air Taxicab Company, Incorporated"", so named because their one taxi has no top. Their old vehicle has broken down, causing a traffic jam. Stuck in the traffic jam are John Blair and his wife, who were on their way to meet an old family friend at the train station, Richard Williams. When the Blairs do not show up, he makes his own way to their house, where he meets their daughter, Jean, who was also his childhood sweetheart. The two reignite their old flame, much to the chagrin of Ralph Crawford, who has been attempting to woo Jean himself.
That night, prior to attending a meeting at their lodge, the Mystic Knights of the Sea, they are hired to transport Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club band to a party being given at the Blair estate. While they are on their way, Richard is confiding to John Blair his feelings for his daughter, and also stating that he has no intention of pursuing Jean unless he can afford to start his own business to support them. After the death of his father, Richard's family lost all their money. He has come up to New York because his grandfather used to own a large home in Harlem, and he hopes to be able to find the deed to it, in order to sell it for the money needed to start his business. He thinks the deed must be hidden somewhere on the property itself. Unknown to Blair or Richard, is that Ralph is eavesdropping on their conversation.
After his discussion with Blair, Richard runs into Amos and Andy, who used to work for his father down south, and they are all happy to see one another. Having delivered their fare, the two cab drivers rush back to town to attend their lodge meeting. The lodge has an annual tradition where a pair of members must spend a night in a haunted house in Harlem, and find a document labeled, ""Check and Double Check"". Once they find it, they are to replace it, in a different location, with their own version, for the lodge members to find the following year. The haunted house in question in none other than the house previously owned by Richard's grandfather.
As Amos and Andy are searching for their document, Ralph is also in the house with several of his cohorts, searching for the deed, in order to thwart Richard's chances with Jean. Amos and Andy find their document, but then realize they did not bring any other paper to write their message on and secrete for their lodge brothers. In searching for something to write on, they stumble on the deed to premises. As they are about to write their message on the back, they are interrupted by Ralph and his friends, who believe that the two have found the deed. In the confusion which ensues, the cab drivers hand over what everyone believes is the deed, before they scamper out of the building. However, when they return to the lodge, they realize that they had given the Check and Double Check paper to Ralph, instead of the dead. They do not know the importance of the document they have, but they recognized Richard's grandfather's signature on it, and intend to deliver it to Richard the following day.
After failing to find the deed, a heartbroken Richard leaves for the railway station, intending to return home. Amos and Andy arrive at the Blair house too late to give him the deed, but race to the station and are able to hand over the deed just before Richard's train leaves. Now with the deed, Richard can sell the house, open his business, and marry Jean.",amo andi run fresh air taxicab compani incorpor name one taxi top old vehicl broken caus traffic jam stuck traffic jam john blair wife way meet old famili friend train station richard william blair show make way hous meet daughter jean also childhood sweetheart two reignit old flame much chagrin ralph crawford attempt woo jean night prior attend meet lodg mystic knight sea hire transport duke ellington cotton club band parti given blair estat way richard confid john blair feel daughter also state intent pursu jean unless afford start busi support death father richard famili lost money come new york grandfath use larg home harlem hope abl find deed order sell money need start busi think deed must hidden somewher properti unknown blair richard ralph eavesdrop convers discuss blair richard run amo andi use work father south happi see one anoth deliv fare two cab driver rush back town attend lodg meet lodg annual tradit pair member must spend night haunt hous harlem find document label check doubl check find replac differ locat version lodg member find follow year haunt hous question none hous previous own richard grandfath amo andi search document ralph also hous sever cohort search deed order thwart richard chanc jean amo andi find document realiz bring paper write messag secret lodg brother search someth write stumbl deed premis write messag back interrupt ralph friend believ two found deed confus ensu cab driver hand everyon believ deed scamper build howev return lodg realiz given check doubl check paper ralph instead dead know import document recogn richard grandfath signatur intend deliv richard follow day fail find deed heartbroken richard leav railway station intend return home amo andi arriv blair hous late give deed race station abl hand deed richard train leav deed richard sell hous open busi marri jean

The two aces of the squadron's ""A Flight"", Courtney (Richard Barthelmess) and Scott (Douglas Fairbanks Jr), have come to hate the commanding officer, Brand (Neil Hamilton), blaming him for sending new recruits directly into combat in inferior aircraft.
Unknown to them, Brand has been arguing continually with higher command to allow practice time for the new pilots, but command is desperate to maintain air superiority and orders them into combat as soon as they arrive. Brand is so disliked by the two he cannot even easily join the men for the nightly partying, drinking alone and clearly breaking under the strain.

1930,For the Defense,American,John Cromwell,"William Powell, Kay Francis, William B. Davidson",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_Defense_(1930_film),"In New York City, William Foster (William Powell) is a criminal defense attorney so successful that prosecutors regard him as a menace. He holds himself to high ethical standards but is willing to mislead without actually lying.
Foster defends a man who planned a murder using explosives. District Attorney Stone (William B. Davidson) displays a vial and says chemical tests have shown that the liquid in it is sensitive nitroglycerin. Foster sniffs the liquid, questions him to verify the chain of custody, and then smashes the vial dramatically on the floor. When order is restored, he explains to the judge that he knew it was safe because nitro has a distinctive smell, and Stone says he had removed the actual nitro for safety after the chemical test. But Foster points out that only the liquid now in the bottle was entered into evidence, and wins his case.
Foster is in love with actress Irene Manners (Kay Francis), and she loves him, but she wants to be married and he does not. When another suitor, Jack Defoe (Scott Kolk), proposes to her, she says she needs to tell Foster about him before she can accept; but she finds she cannot do so. She stays out late enough at night with Defoe to leave only one implication of what they were doing, and while driving him home, she does agree to marry him. He suddenly hugs her and she loses control of the car, killing a bystander.
To protect Irene's reputation, Defoe urges her to leave the scene, lying that the victim is not badly hurt. Presumed to have been driving while drunk, he is charged with manslaughter. They both still conceal her involvement, but she begs Foster to defend him. He asks why she cares enough about Defoe to insist; she says she and Defoe are just friends, but she had already promised him on Foster's behalf, assuming Foster would be willing. Foster agrees, but finds that Defoe cannot tell a credible story at trial.
Then Foster finds out that Irene was at the accident scene and therefore must be much more than ""just friends"" with Defoe. Foster is crushed, but she still begs him to get Defoe acquitted, while Defoe fears Foster will throw the case and Irene will be charged and convicted as well. Foster eventually puts his love for Irene first and, for the first time in his life, bribes a juror to vote not guilty, hanging the jury.
Foster is quickly found out and arrested, and defends himself at trial. As he will not see Irene, she goes to Stone, admits what really happened at the accident, and says Foster was only trying to protect her. If Stone does not agree to recommend mercy, Irene says, she will tell her story in court. Stone says he will think about it.
Although his defense is going well, Foster then offers to plead guilty (and thus be disbarred, no doubt making life easier for prosecutors in future) if only Stone will agree not to retry Defoe; but Stone says he does not make deals. Back in court, Irene sends Foster a note pleading to let her testify and tell the truth. To protect her, Foster immediately changes his plea to guilty. Stone then tells Foster that neither Defoe nor Irene will be prosecuted.
As Foster arrives at Sing Sing to serve his sentence, Irene is there and says she will be waiting for him when he comes out. He says that if she does, then he will marry her.",new york citi william foster william powel crimin defens attorney success prosecutor regard menac hold high ethic standard will mislead without actual lie foster defend man plan murder use explos district attorney stone william b davidson display vial say chemic test shown liquid sensit nitroglycerin foster sniff liquid question verifi chain custodi smash vial dramat floor order restor explain judg knew safe nitro distinct smell stone say remov actual nitro safeti chemic test foster point liquid bottl enter evid win case foster love actress iren manner kay franci love want marri anoth suitor jack defo scott kolk propos say need tell foster accept find stay late enough night defo leav one implic drive home agre marri suddenli hug lose control car kill bystand protect iren reput defo urg leav scene lie victim badli hurt presum drive drunk charg manslaught still conceal involv beg foster defend ask care enough defo insist say defo friend alreadi promis foster behalf assum foster would will foster agre find defo tell credibl stori trial foster find iren accid scene therefor must much friend defo foster crush still beg get defo acquit defo fear foster throw case iren charg convict well foster eventu put love iren first first time life bribe juror vote guilti hang juri foster quickli found arrest defend trial see iren goe stone admit realli happen accid say foster tri protect stone agre recommend merci iren say tell stori court stone say think although defens go well foster offer plead guilti thu disbar doubt make life easier prosecutor futur stone agre retri defo stone say make deal back court iren send foster note plead let testifi tell truth protect foster immedi chang plea guilti stone tell foster neither defo iren prosecut foster arriv sing sing serv sentenc iren say wait come say marri

The native black leader of the tribes in that region is also in love with Dawn and becomes extremely jealous when he hears of Dawn's love for Allen, who, in turn, is sent back to Britain by the Germans for attempting to steal Dawn, whom they believe is half black.
Eventually, the British regain control of the territory and drive out the Germans. Allen returns to the colony. When the settlement experiences a drought, the local tribal leader attempts to incite the natives against Dawn, claiming God is angry because Dawn has dared to love a white man. Allen is unable to save Dawn because the colonial authorities refuse to act unless they have proof that Dawn is one hundred percent white. Eventually Dawn's ""mother"" (Mooda) confesses that she is not Dawn's true mother and that Dawn's real mother was white which Dawn's father confirms.
Allen quickly brings British troops just as the natives are about to sacrifice Dawn. During the ceremony however, one of the virgin priestesses reveals that the jealous tribal leader has been lying about Dawn and that God is not interested in Dawn as she is pure white. Furthermore she reveals that the tribal leader had violated her (the priestess's) chastity and claims the true reason for God's anger was this sacrilegious act. The tribal leader is deposed and sacrificed to the anger of the natives and the drought quickly ends as rain pours down. In the end, Dawn and Allen, happily reunited, sail back to England together.",stori take place coloni africa dawn white girl kidnap infanc brought black nativ mooda run canteen german coloni settlement dawn fall love british rubber planter tom allen prison war nativ black leader tribe region also love dawn becom extrem jealou hear dawn love allen turn sent back britain german attempt steal dawn believ half black eventu british regain control territori drive german allen return coloni settlement experi drought local tribal leader attempt incit nativ dawn claim god angri dawn dare love white man allen unabl save dawn coloni author refus act unless proof dawn one hundr percent white eventu dawn mother mooda confess dawn true mother dawn real mother white dawn father confirm allen quickli bring british troop nativ sacrific dawn ceremoni howev one virgin priestess reveal jealou tribal leader lie dawn god interest dawn pure white furthermor reveal tribal leader violat priestesss chastiti claim true reason god anger sacrilegi act tribal leader depos sacrif anger nativ drought quickli end rain pour end dawn allen happili reunit sail back england togeth

1930,Hell's Angels,American,Howard Hughes,"Jean Harlow, Ben Lyon, James Hall","drama, war",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Angels_(film),"Roy (James Hall) and Monte Rutledge (Ben Lyon) are very different British brothers. Strait-laced Roy loves and idealizes the apparently demure Helen (Jean Harlow). Monte, on the other hand, is a womanizer. Their German friend and fellow Oxford student Karl (John Darrow) is against the idea of having to fight England when World War I breaks out.
Meanwhile, the oblivious Monte is caught in the arms of a woman by her German officer husband (Lucien Prival), who insists upon a duel the next day. Monte flees that night. When Roy is mistaken for his brother, he goes ahead with the duel and is shot in the arm.
Karl is conscripted into the German Air Force, and the two British brothers enlist in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), Monte only to get a kiss from a girl at the recruiting station.
When Roy finally introduces Monte to Helen, she invites Monte to her flat. Monte tries to rebuff her advances for his brother's sake, but gives in. The next morning, however, he is for once ashamed of himself.
Meanwhile, Karl is an officer aboard a Zeppelin airship sent to bomb Trafalgar Square, London. As the bombardier-observer, he is lowered below the clouds in a spy basket. He deliberately guides the Zeppelin over water, where the bombs have no effect. Four RFC fighters are sent to intercept the Zeppelin. Roy pilots one, with Monte as his gunner. To gain altitude more quickly, the airship commander (Carl von Haartman) orders everything possible be jettisoned. When that is not enough, he decides to sacrifice Karl by cutting the cable that secures his pod. He then accepts the advice of another officer; the officer and other crewmen obediently leap to their deaths ""for Kaiser and fatherland"". German machine gunners shoot down three aircraft; Roy and Monte survive a crash landing. After his machine guns jam or run out of ammunition, the last British pilot aloft dives his fighter into the dirigible, sending it crashing in a blazing fireball. The brothers narrowly avoid the debris.
Later, in France, Monte is branded a coward for shirking his duty when his replacement is shot down in his place. When a Staff Colonel asks for two volunteers for a suicide mission, Roy and Monte step up. They are to destroy a vital enemy munitions depot their squadron had tried to blow up for days. They will sneak in using a captured German bomber the next morning so that a British brigade will have a chance in their otherwise hopeless afternoon attack.
That night, Roy discovers a drunk Helen in a nightclub with Captain Redfield. When he tries to take her home, she turns on him, revealing that she never loved him, that she was, in fact, not the young innocent he believed her to be. Devastated, Roy joins Monte for some carousing. Monte decides not to go on the mission and nearly persuades Roy to do the same, but in the end, Roy drags Monte back to the airfield.
The raid on the German munitions dump is successful. However, they are spotted in the act by a flight of German fighters from the Flying Circus, led by Manfred von Richthofen. Monte defends the bomber with a machine gun until their squadron arrives, and a dogfight breaks out. Their buddy ""Baldy"" shoots down the one German who is still targeting the bomber, but then von Richthofen swoops in and shoots the brothers down. They are captured.
They are given the option of talking or facing a firing squad by none other than Roy's old dueling opponent. Monte decides to save his life. Unable to change his brother's mind, Roy convinces Monte that he should speak with the German general alone. He offers to tell what he knows on condition that there is no witness to his treason. The general is persuaded to give him a pistol (with one bullet) to kill Monte. Roy fails to get Monte to do the right thing, and has no choice but to shoot his brother in the back. Afterward, Roy is executed.

1930,Mamba,American,Albert S. Rogell,"Jean Hersholt, Eleanor Boardman",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamba_(film),"The film takes place in Neu Posen, German East Africa sometime before the First World War. ""Mamba"" is the name given to a South African snake. The reptile of this adventure is Auguste Bolte (played by Jean Hersholt), who is constantly reminding those with whom he has a chance to converse that he can buy anything. He neglects his appearance and does not even bother to shave or brush his hair. The German officers hold themselves aloof from him and the only individual he has an opportunity to talk to at length is his valet-secretary, a Cockney, who feeds his master with flattery. One afternoon Bolte recalls that he has received a letter asking for 200,000 marks from Count von Linden. The Count is in Germany and in a footnote it is written that Bolte might marry von Linden's daughter, Helen. The white people of the post have as little to do with Bolte as possible and the British officers across the frontier also spurn him. It occurs to Bolte that a beautiful wife would perhaps help to make life more agreeable for him. He thinks also that the officers would then overlook some of his failings and be quite impressed. He therefore allies himself to Germany.
Helen (played by Eleanor Boardman), like most daughters who marry wealthy villains in melodramas, does so to save her father from ruin. There is a flash of the wedding and soon Helen and her ignoble husband are seen aboard the steamship bound for East Africa. On the same vessel is Karl von Reiden, the officer who is to take charge of the Neu Posen post. He is not averse to a little flirtation with a beautiful woman and therefore when Helen goes out on deck to avoid Bolte, Karl succeeds in meeting her. These scenes are fairly well filmed and the color effects are capital. Karl, played by Ralph Forbes, is a handsome fellow. So soon as he knows that Bolte is Helen's husband he realizes that the marriage is not to her liking. Later these passengers are on the river boat, and when that craft reaches Neu Posen. Bolte stands on the aft deck hoping to make all the German officers envious of his attractive bride. He later gives a feast and takes good care to make a show of his wealth, even to having a procession of natives carrying the viands.
A visit from a native woman interrupts the proceedings, and in a subsequent passage Bolte, enraged with his wife, is about to flog her with a whip when Karl comes to the rescue. All this happens just prior to the World War, and in the closing chapters word is received by both the Germans and the British that hostilities have been declared. Bolte, the snake, believes that money can buy his freedom from military service, but soon he learns otherwise. He is compelled to don a uniform and then decides to run away. His end is sudden, for he fires at one group of natives without knowing that others are behind him. They know something about Bolte and his pleas for his life fall on deaf ears. There follow episodes in which Karl goes to the rescue of Helen and others, who are in danger of an attack by the natives. These are pictured with due attention for red blood on the hero's shirt. It seems that the Britishers might have been more solicitous about Karl's wounds, but all the British commandant says when he comes up to Karl is to ask him whether he will have another Piccadilly cigarette.",film take place neu posen german east africa sometim first world war mamba name given south african snake reptil adventur august bolt play jean hersholt constantli remind chanc convers buy anyth neglect appear even bother shave brush hair german offic hold aloof individu opportun talk length valetsecretari cockney feed master flatteri one afternoon bolt recal receiv letter ask 200000 mark count von linden count germani footnot written bolt might marri von linden daughter helen white peopl post littl bolt possibl british offic across frontier also spurn occur bolt beauti wife would perhap help make life agreeabl think also offic would overlook fail quit impress therefor alli germani helen play eleanor boardman like daughter marri wealthi villain melodrama save father ruin flash wed soon helen ignobl husband seen aboard steamship bound east africa vessel karl von reiden offic take charg neu posen post avers littl flirtat beauti woman therefor helen goe deck avoid bolt karl succe meet scene fairli well film color effect capit karl play ralph forb handsom fellow soon know bolt helen husband realiz marriag like later passeng river boat craft reach neu posen bolt stand aft deck hope make german offic enviou attract bride later give feast take good care make show wealth even process nativ carri viand visit nativ woman interrupt proceed subsequ passag bolt enrag wife flog whip karl come rescu happen prior world war close chapter word receiv german british hostil declar bolt snake believ money buy freedom militari servic soon learn otherwis compel uniform decid run away end sudden fire one group nativ without know other behind know someth bolt plea life fall deaf ear follow episod karl goe rescu helen other danger attack nativ pictur due attent red blood hero shirt seem british might solicit karl wound british command say come karl ask whether anoth piccadilli cigarett

Mr. and Mrs. Tidmarsh (Dick Henderson and Emily Fitzroy), a middle-class English couple, are giving a dinner party in honor of their wealthy uncle, Gabriel Gilwattle (Albert Gran), hoping to receive his financial aid in their struggle to keep up appearances.
As a result of many of the invitees informing Mrs. Tidmarsh that they could not attend her party, she believes that only 13 guests will show up.

In the meantime some other guests inform Fitzroy that they won't be able to come and the hired man is no longer needed. She informs the agency that the man is no longer needed. Nevertheless, when Barrymore arrives at the door, they automatically assume that he was sent by the agency and invite him in to dinner.
Mayhem ensues. Margery Seaton (Loretta Young), one of the dinner guests, recognizes Barrymore as a former lover, and therefore assumes him to be an impostor.

1930,Min and Bill,American,George W. Hill,"Marie Dressler, Wallace Beery",comedy drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_and_Bill,"Min Divot (Marie Dressler) runs a dockside inn. She has been raising Nancy Smith (Dorothy Jordan) as her own since her prostitute mother, Bella (Majorie Rambeau), left her at the inn as an infant. Min frequently argues with fisherman Bill (Wallace Beery). Despite Bill's near-constant drinking, Min and he care for each other. Bill and she are the only ones who know the identity of Nancy's real, still living, mother.
Min does her best to raise Nancy and keep her from learning about the real activities of the people who live and work on the docks. Despite not having much extra money or a home outside her inn, Min does her best to raise Nancy into a young lady. She does everything she can to make sure Nancy is never around when Bella arrives for a visit.
Nancy loves Min as her own mother and frequently skips school to be with her. After repeatedly dealing with the truant officer, Min uses the money she had hidden in her room to send Nancy to a fancy boarding school. She hopes the school will teach Nancy better manners than what she had been picking up from Bill and the others on the docks. The schooling works and Nancy returns to Min with good manners, an education, and the news that she is now engaged to a very wealthy man. She wants Min to attend the wedding.
Min is thrilled until she finds out that Bella has returned. Seeing how happy Nancy is to be getting married (and the wedding will be taking place in a few days), Min deliberately argues with Nancy and says terrible things she does not mean for Nancy to immediately leave. She is mad at herself for hurting Nancy, but is relieved that she is gone by the time Bella arrives. Min stalls Bella, hoping the wedding will take place and the couple can leave for their honeymoon before Bella can interfere.
Bella arrives as the ceremony takes place. She confronts Min in an upstairs room in her inn. She has discovered her daughter's identity, and that of her very wealthy new husband. She taunts Min with the information and pledges to torment Nancy and her new husband until they give her money and take her into their new home.
Min thinks about the wedding and Nancy's happiness and tries to prevent Bella from leaving. When Bella attacks Min with a hot curling iron and attempts to leave, Min takes a hidden gun and shoots her dead. Min drops the gun and flees the room. Bill, knowing what was going on, tries to help Min, but she leaves the inn. Min wants to see Nancy one last time. She sees the happy couple as they are about to board a boat to their honeymoon. Min watches, but decides not to let Nancy know she is there and stays hidden in the crowd. Two police officers quietly confront Min about the shooting at the inn. Min does not say much. She takes one final look at a smiling Nancy as she leaves with her husband. Min turns back and smiles as she quietly walks away with the officers.

Joan then impulsively gets off at the next whistle stop, where she meets Larry (Johnny Mack Brown), a Texas cowboy. He is a rancher on John Prescott's land, and does not know who Joan is. He expresses dismay at how spoiled Prescott's daughters are. Joan conceals her identity, refusing to say her name. She tells him to think of something he loves and call her that, and he chooses ""Montana.""
Joan and Larry fall for one another and are married. When they return to her father's ranch, the couple are nervous that he will not approve of the pairing. However, to their surprise, John Prescott is delighted for the couple and believes Larry is the kind of person who can finally settle Joan. At their party, celebrating their nuptials, Joan sees Jeff, with whom Joan does a daring dance. As they finish dancing, Joan and Jeff share a lingering kiss. After Jeff and Larry come to blows, Joan is embarrassed that Larry resorted to violence.
As Joan became familiar with Larry's posse of cowboy friends, she wants Larry to be accustomed to her group of highbrow city friends who are in Montana with John Prescott. She wants to go back to New York where the couple can live comfortably, but Larry feels it is his duty as a husband to provide for his wife and having her father take care of him is not an option.
Later at another party, Larry catches Jeff trying to make another move on Joan, and the married couple get into a fight. In a fit of rage, she tells Larry that marrying him was the greatest mistake of her life and tells him to leave her alone. As he is walking away, she realizes her mistake and begs to be forgiven, but he rebuffs her.

1930,Morocco,American,Josef von Sternberg,"Marlene Dietrich, Gary Cooper, Adolphe Menjou",drama,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_(film),"The film is set in the late 1920s. It opens in Morocco, with the French Foreign Legion returning from a campaign. Among them is Légionnaire Private Tom Brown (Gary Cooper). Meanwhile, on a ship bound for Morocco is the disillusioned nightclub singer Amy Jolly (Marlene Dietrich). Wealthy La Bessière (Adolphe Menjou) attempts to make her acquaintance, offering to assist her on her first trip to Morocco. When she politely refuses any help, he gives her his calling card, which she later tears up and tosses away.
They meet again at the nightclub where she is a new headliner. Also in the audience is Private Tom Brown (Gary Cooper). Amy, who comes out in a tophat and tails, is first greeted by boos, which she coolly ignores. Tom begins to clap, interrupting their jeers, and others follow suit. After the noise subsides she sings her number (""Quand l'amour Meurt"" or ""When Love Dies"") and is met with ecstatic applause. Seeing a woman in the audience with a flower in her hair, she asks if she may keep it, to which the woman responds ""of course"". She playfully kisses the woman on the mouth, and throws the flower to Private Tom Brown. Her second performance (""What am I bid for my Apple?""), this time in feminine dress, is also a hit. After the number she sells apples to the audience, including La Bessière and Tom Brown. When Amy gives the latter his ""change"", she slips him her key.
That night, Tom sets out to take Amy up on her offer. On the street he encounters Adjudant Caesar's wife (Eve Southern). It is clear that she has a past clandestine relationship with him, which she desires intensely to maintain, but Toms rejects her. Entering Amy's house, they become acquainted. Her house is plastered with photos from her past, which she, like a Foreign Legion soldier, reveals nothing of. He asks Amy if the man in the photographs is her husband, and she answers that she has never found someone good enough, a sentiment shared by Tom. She has become embittered with life and men after repeated betrayals, and asks if he can restore her faith in men. He answers that he is the wrong man for that, and that no one should have faith in him. As they talk, she finds herself coming to like him. Unwilling to risk heartbreak once again, she asks him to leave before anything serious happens. As he leaves, he encounters Caesar's wife again. Her husband, Tom's commanding officer, watches undetected from the shadows. Meanwhile, Amy changes her mind and seeks Tom out. With Amy in arm, Tom leaves Madame Caesar, who then hires two street ruffians to attack the couple. Tom manages to seriously wound both, while he and Amy escape unscathed.
The next day, Tom is brought before Adjutant Caesar (who had been watching them clandestinely) on the charge of injuring two allegedly harmless natives. Amy clears him, but Caesar makes him aware that he knows about Tom's involvement with his wife. La Bessière, whose affections for Amy continue unabated, knows her concern for Tom and offers to use his weight with Caesar to lighten his punishment. Instead of a court martial, Tom is released from detention and ordered to leave for Amalfi Pass with a detachment commanded by Caesar. He suspects that Caesar intends to rid himself of his romantic rival, and fears for his life were he to go. Amy is saddened by the news that he is leaving. Meanwhile, Tom, war-weary and enamored with Amy, plans to desert to be with her.
That night at the nightclub, La Bessière enters Amy's dressing room. He gifts her with a lavish bracelet, which she attempts to refuse, before setting it on her table. At the same time Tom, intending to tell her of his plans, arrives at the door of her dressing room. Tom overhears La Bessière offer to marry Amy, an offer she politely turns down. La Bessière asks her if it is because she is in love, to which she responds that she doesn't think she is. Asking her if she would make the same choice if not for ""a certain private in the Foreign Legion"", she answers that she does not know. After hearing this Tom knocks on the door, and La Bessière kindly lets them alone so Tom can say goodbye to her. As they embrace, Amy tells him not to go, and he responds that that's what he intended to do. He will desert and board a train to Europe, but if she would join him. She agrees to this. A buzzer signals it is time for her to perform, and she asks him to wait for her to return. After she departs, he notices the lavish bracelet on her dressing room table. Though he has fallen in love with her himself, Tom decides that she would be better off with a rich man than with a poor Legionnaire. He writes on her mirror, ""I changed my mind. Good luck!"".
The next day Amy arrives with La Bessière to see the company's departure, so that she can bid Tom farewell. Adding further injury, he hides the depth of his feelings for her by having several women in his company, who cling to him so doggedly that Amy must maneuver herself between them to shake his hand. She asks La Bessière about the women trailing after the company, who explains that they follow the men. She wonders how they keep pace with them, and he answers ""Sometimes they catch up with them, and sometimes they don't. And very often when they do, they find their men dead."" Amy remarks that the women must be mad to do such a thing, to which La Bessière responds ""I don't know. You see, they love their men.""
On the march to Amalfi Pass, Tom's company detachment runs into a machine gun nest. Caesar orders Tom to deal with it, and Tom suspects it is a suicide mission. To his surprise, Caesar decides to accompany him. Caesar is killed by the enemy.
Though in a relationship with La Bessière, Amy pines for Tom. She is devastated by his treatment of her, and begins drinking heavily and acting erratically at work. La Bessière enters her dressing room to find her singing gayly. He asks if she is in high spirits because she has heard news of Tom. She leads him to the mirror to show him the note Tom left, which she had hidden behind a flower pot. Still concealing her grief, she asks him to pour her a drink, before throwing its contents on the mirror and breaking the glass. La Bessière consoles her, and Amy eventually accepts his proposal.
Later, at their engagement party, La Bessière and Amy learn that what's left of Tom's detachment has returned. Frantic, Amy rushes outside, but learns that Tom was wounded and left behind to recuperate in a hospital. She informs La Bessière that she must go to Tom that very night; and wanting only her happiness, he drives her there.
She finds that Tom has not been injured at all, but has instead been faking an injury to avoid combat. Instead of the hospital ward, he has been residing in a canteen. Accompanying him is a native woman, who attempts to console him, knowing he is brokenhearted over leaving his love. He has carved ""AMY JOLLY"" inside a heart, covered by a heap of cigarette butts from his chain smoking. When Amy arrives, Tom asks her if she is married, to which she answers in the negative. He then asks if she plans to marry La Bessière, to which she replies with a yes. He encourages her to marry him, not revealing his feelings for her. As he prepares to join his new unit, she finds his knife on the table, which he has forgotten. When he returns to collect it, she remarks that he has also forgotten to say goodbye. He asks her to see the unit off as they leave at dawn. Alone and distraught, Amy sifts through the pile of playing cards and cigarettes, and finds the heart with her name in it. The next morning she attends as his unit disembarks. Amy is torn in leaving him with the knowledge of his love for her, but when she sees a handful of native women stubbornly following the Legionnaires they love, she joins them.",film set late 1920 open morocco french foreign legion return campaign among légionnair privat tom brown gari cooper meanwhil ship bound morocco disillus nightclub singer ami jolli marlen dietrich wealthi la bessièr adolph menjou attempt make acquaint offer assist first trip morocco polit refus help give call card later tear toss away meet nightclub new headlin also audienc privat tom brown gari cooper ami come tophat tail first greet boo coolli ignor tom begin clap interrupt jeer other follow suit nois subsid sing number quand lamour meurt love die met ecstat applaus see woman audienc flower hair ask may keep woman respond cours play kiss woman mouth throw flower privat tom brown second perform bid appl time feminin dress also hit number sell appl audienc includ la bessièr tom brown ami give latter chang slip key night tom set take ami offer street encount adjud caesar wife eve southern clear past clandestin relationship desir intens maintain tom reject enter ami hous becom acquaint hous plaster photo past like foreign legion soldier reveal noth ask ami man photograph husband answer never found someon good enough sentiment share tom becom embitt life men repeat betray ask restor faith men answer wrong man one faith talk find come like unwil risk heartbreak ask leav anyth seriou happen leav encount caesar wife husband tom command offic watch undetect shadow meanwhil ami chang mind seek tom ami arm tom leav madam caesar hire two street ruffian attack coupl tom manag serious wound ami escap unscath next day tom brought adjut caesar watch clandestin charg injur two allegedli harmless nativ ami clear caesar make awar know tom involv wife la bessièr whose affect ami continu unab know concern tom offer use weight caesar lighten punish instead court martial tom releas detent order leav amalfi pass detach command caesar suspect caesar intend rid romant rival fear life go ami sadden news leav meanwhil tom warweari enamor ami plan desert night nightclub la bessièr enter ami dress room gift lavish bracelet attempt refus set tabl time tom intend tell plan arriv door dress room tom overhear la bessièr offer marri ami offer polit turn la bessièr ask love respond doesnt think ask would make choic certain privat foreign legion answer know hear tom knock door la bessièr kindli let alon tom say goodby embrac ami tell go respond that intend desert board train europ would join agre buzzer signal time perform ask wait return depart notic lavish bracelet dress room tabl though fallen love tom decid would better rich man poor legionnair write mirror chang mind good luck next day ami arriv la bessièr see compani departur bid tom farewel ad injuri hide depth feel sever women compani cling doggedli ami must maneuv shake hand ask la bessièr women trail compani explain follow men wonder keep pace answer sometim catch sometim dont often find men dead ami remark women must mad thing la bessièr respond dont know see love men march amalfi pass tom compani detach run machin gun nest caesar order tom deal tom suspect suicid mission surpris caesar decid accompani caesar kill enemi though relationship la bessièr ami pine tom devast treatment begin drink heavili act errat work la bessièr enter dress room find sing gayli ask high spirit heard news tom lead mirror show note tom left hidden behind flower pot still conceal grief ask pour drink throw content mirror break glass la bessièr consol ami eventu accept propos later engag parti la bessièr ami learn what left tom detach return frantic ami rush outsid learn tom wound left behind recuper hospit inform la bessièr must go tom night want happi drive find tom injur instead fake injuri avoid combat instead hospit ward resid canteen accompani nativ woman attempt consol know brokenheart leav love carv ami jolli insid heart cover heap cigarett butt chain smoke ami arriv tom ask marri answer neg ask plan marri la bessièr repli ye encourag marri reveal feel prepar join new unit find knife tabl forgotten return collect remark also forgotten say goodby ask see unit leav dawn alon distraught ami sift pile play card cigarett find heart name next morn attend unit disembark ami torn leav knowledg love see hand nativ women stubbornli follow legionnair love join

Raffles (Ronald Colman) decides to give up his criminal ways as the notorious ""Amateur Cracksman"" after falling in love with Lady Gwen (Kay Francis). However, when his friend Bunny Manders (Bramwell Fletcher) tries to commit suicide because of a gambling debt he cannot repay, Raffles decides to take on one more job for Bunny's sake. He joins Bunny and Gwen as guests of Lord and Lady Melrose, with an eye toward acquiring the Melrose necklace, once the property of Empress Joséphine.
Complications arise when a gang of thieves also decides to try for the necklace at the same time. Inspector Mackenzie of Scotland Yard (David Torrence) gets wind of their plot and shows up at the Melrose estate with his men. Burglar Crawshaw breaks into the house and succeeds in stealing the jewelry, only to have Raffles take it away from him. Crawshaw is caught by the police, but learns his robber's identity.
Meanwhile, both Gwen and Mackenzie suspect that Raffles is the famous jewel thief. When the necklace is not found, Mackenzie insists that all the guests remain inside, then quickly changes his mind. Gwen overhears Mackenzie tell one of his men that he intends to let Crawshaw escape, expecting the crook to go after Raffles and thereby incriminate him. She follows Raffles back to London to warn him.
Crawshaw does as Mackenzie anticipated. However, Raffles convinces Crawshaw that it is too dangerous to pursue his original goal with all the policemen around and helps him escape. Then, Raffles publicly confesses to being the Amateur Cracksman.

On their way back to the RCMP post, however, their sled overturns. Keith takes Conniston's gun and sled and leaves the policeman and his guide to die in the snow. Keith starts to feel guilty about what he has done. He turns back and takes the men to an emergency cabin. In spite of this, Conniston dies of a frozen lung.
After talking to Keith for a while, O'Toole becomes convinced of his innocence. He coaches Keith so that he can pass himself off as the sergeant. O'Toole is not well enough to travel, so Keith goes to the RCMP post alone.
Once he arrives, Keith tells McDowell (David Torrence), the post commanding officer, that it was Keith who died. McDowell then informs him that Keith was innocent; the real murderer confessed. Worried that he will be accused of Conniston's murder if his true identity is discovered, Keith plans to escape across the border.
There are complications. Miriam (Evalyn Knapp), McDowell's daughter, had been Conniston's girl, but she decided to break up with him. Keith is very much attracted to her, and proves to be much more romantic than Conniston. Miriam finds herself falling in love with him. Mickey (Frank Coghlan, Jr.), O'Toole's young son, had adopted Conniston as a substitute father. He eventually realizes that Keith is not the sergeant, but Keith manages to persuade him to keep his secret.
Keith goes to see McDowell to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage, only to discover that a jealous rival had made inquiries. Conniston, it turns out, was married. McDowell orders him to leave the base in disgrace. Before he goes, he confesses the truth to Miriam.
